# Butterfly Tenergy 05 Hard

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Verdict

* **One-Line Definition:** "Armoring the Legendary Spin in Steel: An Uncompromising Power Machine for Professionals."
* **Style:** Extreme Offensive / Power Loop (Drive)
* **Overall Score:** **9.2 / 10** (Note: This score applies only if the user has advanced-level impact. For beginners/intermediates, the score may be below 5.0).

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **43 degrees (Butterfly Standard)**
* *Analysis:* It is significantly harder than the standard Tenergy 05 (36 degrees). When converted to the ESN (German) standard, it corresponds to a very hard sponge in the **53 to 55-degree** range.


* **Weight:** **Heavy**
* *Analysis:* It weighs approximately 50g~53g after cutting (standard head size). It is noticeably heavier than the regular Tenergy 05.


* **Recommended Thickness:** 2.1mm (Spring Sponge)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **8.5 / 10**
* It does not offer "automatic" speed where the ball flies far effortlessly. With weak impact, the ball might even feel dead. However, the **non-linear energy** released when the user strikes with full force is explosive. The top-speed ceiling is extremely high.


* **Spin:** **9.8 / 10**
* This is the reason for this rubber's existence. Because the hard sponge holds up, the rubber does not "bottom out" even during powerful swings, allowing you to utilize 100% of the topsheet's grip. It produces a heavy, menacing spin ball.


* **Control:** **6.5 / 10**
* To be honest, it is difficult to handle. The sweet spot is relatively narrow, and if impact accuracy drops, the ball may dump into the net or fly erratically. However, thanks to its **stiffness that doesn't yield to incoming spin**, it provides surprising stability during counter-loops or blocks.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium-High**
* While slightly lower than the very high arc of the standard Tenergy 05, it is still on the higher side. Instead of just arching up, the trajectory is more aggressive, driving **forward and dipping sharply**.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky vs. Solid:** **Solid & Stiff**
* There is almost none of the signature "springy" or crisp "clicky" feel of the standard Tenergy. It feels firm, like hitting a brick, and the shock transmitted to the fingertips upon impact is significant.


* **Dwell Time:**
* On weak touches, the dwell time feels short, as if the ball bounces off immediately. However, **on strong impact, you can clearly feel the rubber "biting" the ball tight before shooting it out.**



## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Overwhelming Spin and Power:** On a full swing, the ball quality is extremely heavy, and the force with which the ball kicks after the bounce is powerful.
* **Unyielding Counters:** The sponge does not collapse under the opponent's strong drives, allowing you to take the upper hand in topspin rallies.
* **Durability and Consistency:** The lifespan feels somewhat longer than the standard Tenergy 05, and performance degradation is minimal even with hard hitting.


* **Cons:**
* **Heavy Weight:** Attaching this to both sides will significantly increase the total racket weight, potentially straining the wrist.
* **Extreme Difficulty:** With poor or average impact, you won't even extract 50% of the rubber's performance, and balls will likely end up in the net.
* **High Price:** Butterfly's premium pricing policy remains a burden.



## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Elite Players & Top-tier Amateurs:** Players with fully developed impact mechanics and fast swing speeds.
* **Power Loopers:** Players who aim for a one-shot kill or want power that doesn't fade even from mid-to-far distance.
* **Existing T05 Users who:** Feel the standard T05 is "too mushy/springy" with the plastic ball or feel a lack of power.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** The optimal position for a powerful finishing shot. It is generally too heavy and demanding for the backhand.


* **Similar Rubbers (Other Brands):**
* **Tibhar Evolution MX-P 50:** Often cited as a cost-effective alternative to T05 Hard.
* **Donic Bluestorm Pro:** Similar concept of a hard sponge combined with strong spin capabilities.
* **DHS Hurricane 3 (Boosted):** While it is a tacky rubber, it shares a similar performance realm regarding the hard sponge feel and powerful spin generation.

**Coach's Tip:**

> "Tenergy 05 Hard is less of a 'weapon' and more like **'heavy machinery.'** If you have the strength (impact) to operate this equipment, you will dominate the battlefield. However, if your power is insufficient, you will be crushed by the weight of the equipment itself. Check first if your impact is strong enough to sink the ball deep into this hard sponge."
