# Zyre 03

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **"Breaking norms with a 2.7mm thickness, unlocking a new dimension of spin."**
* **Overall Style:** Ultra-Offensive (Spin-Oriented)
* **Overall Score:** 9.8 / 10

**Review:**
Evaluated as the "4th Generation" rubber that surpasses the existing Dignics series, this is Butterfly's top-tier flagship model released to shake up the table tennis world in late 2025. Its most defining feature is the **unprecedented 2.7mm sponge thickness**, made possible by an incredibly thin top sheet (Ricosheet). It boasts overwhelming spin rates and heavy ball quality, yet it successfully suppresses weight relative to its thickness, setting a new standard for modern table tennis. If you can overcome the price barrier, this is the best spin machine currently in existence.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** 44 degrees (Butterfly Standard)
* *Note: Approximately 54~55 degrees on the ESN (German) scale. It is hard, but feels softer upon impact.*


* **Weight:** Medium
* *Special Note: Despite the 2.7mm thickness, it achieves remarkable weight reduction, weighing about 2g less than Dignics 09C (2.1mm).*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.5mm** (Balance priority), **2.7mm** (Power/One-shot priority)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** 8.8 / 10
* It doesn't have the bounciness of Tenergy 64 or Dignics 80. However, the 'deep trajectory' generated by the thick sponge is superb, and the final speed (velocity after the bounce) when fully impacted is powerful enough to be difficult for opponents to block.


* **Spin:** **10.0 / 10 (MAX)**
* The reason for this rubber's existence. The 'Shape No. 303' pimple structure and the new top sheet generate a terrifying amount of spin the moment they brush the ball. It grips the ball perfectly without slipping, especially during close-to-table counter drives.


* **Control:** 8.5 / 10
* Since the rebound is not excessively high, short games (stops, pushes) are stable. However, due to the 2.7mm sponge, if you lack delicate touch, the ball may feel a bit bouncy during service reception.


* **Throw Angle:** High
* The ball clears the net with a high arc and drops dramatically at the end line. It eliminates the fear of net errors.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Feeling:** Solid + Deep Dwell
* **Detailed Description:**
* Rather than a 'Clicky' metallic sound, it feels closer to a heavy **'Thud'**, as if it's capturing the ball deep into the sponge before shooting it out.
* The typical 'muted' feeling of hard rubbers has been dramatically improved thanks to the harmony between 'Spring Sponge X' and the thin top sheet. The feedback transmitted to the fingertips at the moment of impact is very clear.



## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Overwhelming Sponge Power:** The energy transfer from the 2.7mm thickness provides power that doesn't lose out even in mid-to-far distance rallies.
* **Phenomenal Spin Retention:** Even in long rallies, the grip remains consistent, holding onto the ball until the very end without slipping.
* **Weight Efficiency:** Despite being an ultra-high-performance/ultra-thick rubber, the weight burden is low, making it possible to attach it to both sides.


* **Cons:**
* **Exorbitant Price:** The price, hovering around $120 (MSRP), is a massive entry barrier for amateur players.
* **Impact Requirement:** With a lazy swing (just blocking, etc.), you won't get even 50% of the rubber's performance. A solid swing mechanism is required.
* **Adaptation Period:** Users accustomed to the standard 2.1mm (MAX) thickness may need time to adjust to the unique hitting sensation of the 2.7mm sponge.



## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* High-level amateurs (top tier competitors).
* **Close/Mid-distance Loopers** who possess strong impact and rely on heavy spin drives.
* Users who liked the spin of Dignics 09C but felt the distance/trajectory was lacking.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly Recommended (2.7mm)
* **Backhand:** Recommended for Advanced Players (2.5mm)


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly Dignics 09C:** Zyre 03 is slightly softer, has a longer trajectory, and is lighter.
* **Xiom Jekyll & Hyde H52.5:** Similar high throw angle and spin-oriented nature, but Zyre 03 has a higher performance ceiling.

**[Coach's Tip]**
Zyre 03 is not equipment that *creates* skill, but rather a rubber that **'amplifies prepared skill by 120%.'** If you are confident in your drive impact, this rubber will show you a 'whole new world.' If you let me know your current blade (racket) information, I can further advise whether 2.5mm or 2.7mm would be the better balance for you.
