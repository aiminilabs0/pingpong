# Butterfly Tenergy 64 FX

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"Flash-like speed generated from a soft impact—the ultimate savior of your backhand."**

* **Style:** Soft Offensive / Speed-Oriented
* **Overall Score:** **8.8** / 10.0
* *Comment:* This rubber combines the fast speed design of the Tenergy 64 with the soft FX sponge. It is the king of 'efficiency,' allowing players to easily send powerful balls even with weak impact.



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:**
* **32° (Butterfly Standard)** / Approx. **42~43° (ESN/German Standard)**
* Classified as **Very Soft**.


* **Weight:** **Light**
* Thanks to the "Spring Sponge" (which contains many air bubbles) and the soft hardness, it is lighter than typical high-hardness rubbers. It is advantageous for those who want to reduce the total weight of their racket.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Max)**
* Since the hardness is very low, I recommend using the maximum thickness to ensure enough depth to "hold" the ball, rather than using a thinner sponge.



## 3. Performance Analysis (Scale of 0~10)

* **Speed:** **9.0** / 10
* The wide pimple geometry unique to the Tenergy 64, combined with the high elasticity of the FX sponge, results in a very fast ejection speed the moment the ball touches the racket. Good distance is achieved with minimal effort.


* **Spin:** **7.5** / 10
* Absolute spin quantity is lower compared to the Tenergy 05 series. It is optimized for fast-tempo speed drives rather than heavy, spinning loops.


* **Control:** **8.5** / 10
* Stability is excellent when blocking or performing technical strokes. However, due to the high repulsion, a delicate touch is required for short play (stops/pushes).


* **Throw Angle:** **Low - Medium**
* The ball tends to travel in a direct, linear trajectory just over the net rather than arcing high. This trajectory makes it difficult for opponents to time their blocks.



## 4. Feeling & Sensation

* **Clicky:** **Very Strong**
* The crisp metallic "Click Sound" (Cheeng!) upon impact is superb. Many club players stick to the FX series specifically for this sound and hand-feel.


* **Dwell Time:** **Long**
* Because the sponge is so soft, you can clearly feel the ball sinking deep into the rubber. However, rather than holding the ball for a long time, it feels more like a trampoline: hugging it deep and then **shooting it out strongly**.


* **Note:** If a player with very strong impact uses this, they may experience "Bottoming Out" (feeling the wood blade through the sponge) as the sponge compresses to its limit.

## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* **Easy Distance:** Even female players or beginners with weaker impact can easily maintain long rallies.
* **Overwhelming Blocking Ability:** Just by lightly placing the racket in the path of the opponent's strong drive on the backhand, the ball returns quickly and sharply.
* **Light Weight:** Puts less stress on the wrist, making it easier to secure fast swing speeds.

**Cons:**

* **Durability Issues:** Like the rest of the Tenergy series, the edges are prone to crumbling/chipping, and the sponge lifespan is not particularly long.
* **Maximum Power Limit:** When attempting a "kill shot" power drive, the force may feel dispersed rather than fully transferred to the ball (due to the soft sponge).
* **Difficult Short Game:** Due to the high bounce of the Spring Sponge, balls intended to be dropped short (stops) often pop up high.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Backhand Block & Drive Style:** Players who focus on stable blocking and directional placement on the backhand.
* **Female Club Players & Juniors:** Those who want to send fast balls with less physical force.
* **Weak Impact Drive Players:** Those with slower swing speeds who find high-hardness rubbers burdensome.


* **Recommended Position:** **Backhand**
* Ideally suited for the backhand side. (Recommended for the forehand only for beginner-to-intermediate players).


* **Similar Rubbers (Alternatives):**
* **Tibhar Evolution FX-P:** Similar hardness and sound; a great value-for-money alternative.
* **Andro Rasanter R37:** Worth comparing if you prefer a very soft sponge and fast speed.

**Expert Tip:** If your current rubber feels too hard, causing the ball to frequently hit the net, or if you experience wrist pain during backhand drives, **Tenergy 64 FX** will be the best prescription for you.
