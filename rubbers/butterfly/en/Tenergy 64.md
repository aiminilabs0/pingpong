# Butterfly Tenergy 64

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"Overwhelming distance and the joy of pure speed: The ultimate weapon for mid-to-long distance players."**

* **Style:** Classic Offensive (Speed & Distance Focused)
* **Overall Score:** **9.1 / 10**
* (Despite being an older model, it holds high value as the "textbook definition" of a speed-focused tension rubber.)



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **36°** (Butterfly Standard)
* *Expert Note:* When converted to the ESN (German) standard, it is approximately **47~48°**. However, due to the wide spacing between the pimples, the actual feeling on impact is softer, around **45°**.


* **Weight:** **Light ~ Average** (Approx. 44~46g after cutting)
* It feels slightly lighter than Tenergy 05, making it excellent for securing fast swing speeds.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Max)**
* Max thickness is highly recommended to maximize its speed performance.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[9.5] / 10**
* Boasts the highest speed among the Tenergy series (05, 80, 64). The elasticity of the 'Spring Sponge' is very strong upon impact, ensuring sufficient flight distance even from mid-to-far distance.


* **Spin:** **[8.5] / 10**
* Absolute spin generation is lower compared to Tenergy 05. Rather than heavy brush loops that "bite" the ball, it is better suited for fast loop drives or smash-drives that rely on speed.


* **Control:** **[8.0] / 10**
* Defensive control is comfortable because it is less sensitive to the opponent's incoming spin during blocks (shorts). However, due to its high repulsion, delicate touch is required for stops or short service returns.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium (Medium ~ Low)**
* Instead of creating a high arc, the ball tends to clear the net slightly and shoot forward in a long, linear trajectory.



## 4. Actual Feeling (Tactile Feedback)

* **Soft & Clicky:**
* While Tenergy 05 has a heavy, 'solid' grip, Tenergy 64 features wider pimple geometry. This allows the ball to sink deep into the rubber and shoot out with a **crisp, clicky sensation** that is very satisfying.


* **Fast Release Speed:**
* The **Dwell Time** is shorter compared to the 05. Rather than holding the ball for a long time, it feels like the ball reacts and launches immediately upon contact. This allows for powerful shots with minimal effort.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Excellent Flight Distance:** Even when playing away from the table (mid-to-long distance), power transfer is easy, and the ball maintains its energy until the end of its trajectory.
* **Ease of Backhand Blocking & Pushing:** When blocking heavy topspin, the ball doesn't pop up high but travels low and fast, making it ideal for counter-attacks.
* **Harmony of Smash and Drive:** It performs well not only for spin-based drives but also for flat hitting (smashing) techniques.

**Cons**

* **Difficulty in Short Game:** Due to the high bounce (catapult effect), stop shots near the net can easily pop up or drift long.
* **Durability:** It suffers from the typical Tenergy issue of "crumbling edges," and performance drops noticeably once the tension effect fades.
* **High Price:** While the performance is guaranteed, the price point remains a significant barrier for many club players.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Mid-distance loopers** who enjoy rallying away from the table.
* **Female or Senior players** who want to generate fast balls with less physical effort.
* Players who rely on **fast-tempo blocks, punches, and flicks** on the backhand side rather than heavy spin.


* **Recommended Position:** **Backhand**
* In the past, players like Jun Mizutani used it on the Forehand, but in the plastic ball era, it performs best as a **Backhand rubber**. It may feel lacking in spin generation for the modern Forehand.


* **Similar Rubbers (Alternatives):**
* **Butterfly Dignics 64:** The upper-tier upgrade of Tenergy 64, offering improved durability and surface grip.
* **Xiom Omega VII Pro:** A speed-focused ESN rubber that offers a similar "fast and clicky" sensation to Tenergy 64.
* **Tibhar Evolution EL-P:** Slightly harder than 64, but a viable alternative offering a good balance of speed and spin.
