# Butterfly Glayzer 09C

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"A 'realistic' high-performance sticky rubber for amateurs, inheriting the DNA of Dignics 09C."**

* **Style:** Close-to-table Topspin & Control Oriented (All-round / Spin Offensive)
* **Overall Score:** **8.8 / 10.0**
* *Comment: This is the best prescription for those who found the 'Dignics 09C' too hard or demanding to handle. It has found a very clever compromise between price and performance.*



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **42 degrees** (Butterfly Standard)
* *Analysis: This is 2 degrees softer than Dignics 09C (44 deg). When converted to other brands' standards (ESN/German), it feels like **50~52 degrees**. However, due to the nature of Spring Sponge X, it feels slightly softer and compresses easier than the numbers suggest.*


* **Weight:** **Average ~ Slightly Heavy** (Approx. 48~50g after cutting / Standard head size)
* *It is a manageable weight for a sticky rubber, but it is not a lightweight rubber.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Tokubetsu/Max)**
* *Maximum thickness is recommended to maximize spin performance.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[ 7.5 ] / 10**
* It is not explosively fast. If your impact is weak, the ball may drop somewhat short. However, it features 'non-linear' repulsion where the ball travels exactly as much as the power you put into it.


* **Spin:** **[ 9.0 ] / 10**
* The reason for this rubber's existence. The slightly sticky top sheet meets the Grey Spring Sponge X to create **powerful topspin**. The ball feels particularly heavy during loop drives.


* **Control:** **[ 9.5 ] / 10**
* **The greatest strength.** It offers excellent stability in 'short game' situations such as Stops, Pushes (Boscut), and Service Returns, where the ball stops exactly where you want it without popping up.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* The arc is high. It is very easy to lift backspin balls (cut balls) over the net without anxiety about hitting the net.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Sensory Characteristic:** **Dampened & Solid**
* **Detailed Description:**
* Rather than a crisp, metallic 'Clicky' feel, it has a strong sensation of **'Holding'** the ball deeply ('Thud' feel).
* The **Dwell Time** (the time the ball stays on the rubber) during impact feels very long. Thanks to this, the user can clearly feel the sensation of "catching and throwing" the ball.
* It provides a much more comfortable and softer hitting feel for those who felt burdened by the distinctive hardness of Dignics 09C.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Overwhelming Connection Stability:** Drastically reduces 'over-misses' (hitting long), which is a common issue for lower-division amateurs.
* **Easy Backspin Attack:** Thanks to the high throw angle and sticky sheet, drives against backspin (cut balls) go over very easily.
* **Value for Money:** You can experience similar technology (Spring Sponge X) at about 60-70% of the price of the flagship model (Dignics).

### **Cons**

* **Lack of "One-Shot" Power:** It lacks the explosive, piercing feel needed for smashes or finishing kill shots (if power is lacking).
* **Distance Issue:** As you move to mid/far distance, the trajectory length drops rapidly, forcing a playstyle closer to the table.
* **Humidity Sensitivity:** Like all sticky rubbers, slippage can occur on days with high humidity, so maintenance is required.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
1. **Loop Drive Beginners/Intermediates:** Those just learning the feeling of looping backspin balls or wanting to increase rally consistency.
2. **Stability-Oriented All-Rounders:** Players who prefer course placement and error-free play over raw power.
3. **Sticky Rubber Entrants:** Those who find Chinese rubbers too hard but German rubbers too bouncy.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Recommended for powerful spin and stable connections.
* **Backhand:** Excellent stability for backhand as well, provided the player has sufficient backhand impact.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Tibhar - Hybrid MK:** The most direct competitor to Glayzer 09C; a slightly sticky rubber with great control.
* **Yasaka - Rakza Z:** Similar in that it is a spin-oriented sticky rubber, though slightly harder.

**[Coach's Advice]**
When using Glayzer 09C, try to extend your swing slightly more forward (**Follow-through**) than usual. Since the rubber holds the ball for a long time, the true value of this rubber—the "end-spin" quality—comes alive when you swing fully and push the ball through to the end.
