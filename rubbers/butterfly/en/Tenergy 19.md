# Butterfly Tenergy 19

## 1. One-Liner & Overall Review

* **Definition:** "A 'Counter-Loop Specialist' that adds deep trajectory to the signature spin of Tenergy 05, designed to pressure opponents."
* **Style:** Aggressive (OFF+) / Loop & Counter-attack focused
* **Overall Score:** **9.2 / 10**

> **Summary:** If Tenergy 05 was the symbol of "Absolute Spin," Tenergy 19 is engineered to make that spin land deep on the opponent's table. Specifically designed for the modern plastic ball (ABS) era, it enhances the grip so the ball doesn't slip on the surface, enabling highly stable and aggressive counter-attacks.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **36° (Butterfly Standard)**
* *Note: Approximately 47~48° when converted to the German ESN standard.*


* **Weight:** **Medium**
* *Similar to or marginally lighter than Tenergy 05, but considered substantial compared to the latest ultra-lightweight rubbers.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Toku-atsu / Max)**
* *Max thickness is recommended to utilize 100% of the Spring Sponge performance.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **9.0 / 10**
* The trajectory is longer than Tenergy 05. Rather than sheer initial velocity, the "speed after the bounce" (kick) and the "depth" of the shot are impressive.


* **Spin:** **9.4 / 10**
* The pimples on the topsheet are thinner and more densely packed than the 05. This provides excellent ball-wrapping ability, creating explosive spin upon strong impact.


* **Control:** **8.5 / 10**
* While trickier than Tenergy 64, it is generally rated as easier to handle than Tenergy 05. Stability is particularly outstanding when counter-looping against an opponent's spin.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium-High**
* Slightly lower than the high arc of Tenergy 05, but still on the higher side. The ball draws a long arc that reaches all the way to the end line rather than dropping short.



## 4. Actual Feeling (Tactile Feedback)

* **Grip:** "A feeling where the ball bites in without slipping."
* The defining characteristic of Tenergy 19 is its **'Non-slip'** nature. Thanks to the dense pimple structure, the ball rarely slips on the topsheet even during thin or weak contact.


* **Click & Hold:**
* There is a distinct sensation of **"holding the ball (Dwell Time) and shooting it out."** Unlike Tenergy 64, which feels like the ball bounces off quickly, T19 holds the ball longer, making it easier for the user to direct the ball.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### Pros

* **Overwhelming Counter Ability:** When counter-looping an opponent's drive, the ball doesn't "die" but plunges deep into the opponent's court.
* **Plastic Ball Adaptation:** It minimizes slippage on the surface, providing consistent spin even in humid conditions or with new, slick balls.
* **Ease of Backhand Use:** For those who found Tenergy 05 a bit demanding on the backhand, T19 offers a great alternative with better length and easier spin generation.

### Cons

* **Price:** Butterfly's characteristically high price point remains a barrier to entry.
* **Durability:** It shares the Tenergy series' chronic issues, such as fragile edges that crumble easily and relatively fast topsheet wear.
* **Impact Requirement:** It is still too bouncy and sensitive for beginners; a certain level of swing speed is required to unlock its full potential.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* Intermediate to advanced amateurs and competitive players.
* Players who like Tenergy 05 but want more distance/depth on their shots.
* Styles that prefer rallying from **mid-distance** (a step back from the table) rather than close-to-table play.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Recommended for Power Loopers.
* **Backhand:** Offers peak performance for advanced players with good impact mechanics.


* **Similar Rubbers (Other Brands):**
* **Tibhar Evolution MX-P:** (Similar focus on spin, but Tenergy 19 feels like it holds the ball better).
* **Nittaku Fastarc G-1:** (Similar tough grip feeling, but Tenergy 19 has the edge in speed/repulsion).



---

**Analyst Tip:** Tenergy 19 isn't just a simple upgrade to Tenergy 05; it is a rubber optimized for **"Modern Rally-Oriented Play."** I highly recommend this if you prefer pushing your opponent back with connecting loops rather than ending the point with a single smash.
