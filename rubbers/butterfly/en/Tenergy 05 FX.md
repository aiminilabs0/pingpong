# Butterfly Tenergy 05 FX

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **One-Line Definition:** "Legendary spin capability meets soft stability—**the eternal textbook for backhand rubbers.**"
* **Overall Tendency:** Balance-oriented Attack (Offensive Control)
* **Overall Score:** **9.2** / 10

> **Review:** Tenergy 05 FX is the perfect alternative for those who find the original Tenergy 05 too demanding. It maintains the unique elasticity of the 'Spring Sponge' while offering a softer feel, allowing players to easily 'hold' the ball and create powerful spin even with less than perfect impact. It is truly a masterpiece for stability.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **32 degrees** (Butterfly Standard)
* *Note: When converted to the German ESN standard, this corresponds to a **Soft** feel of approximately **42~43 degrees**.*


* **Weight:** **Light** (Approx. 44~46g after cutting)
* *It is generally 2~3g lighter than the standard Tenergy 05.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Thick / Max)**
* *Since the sponge is soft, I recommend using the maximum thickness to ensure sufficient flight distance rather than thinner options.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (Scale of 0-10)

* **Speed:** **8.0** / 10
* The absolute maximum distance is shorter compared to the original Tenergy 05 or 64 series. However, the 'initial speed' is excellent, meaning the ball pops off well even with weak impact.


* **Spin:** **9.5** / 10
* Since it shares the same top sheet as the Tenergy 05, the spin performance is top-tier. The soft sponge wraps deeply around the ball, making it very easy to generate heavy rotation during loop drives.


* **Control:** **9.5** / 10
* This is the rubber's greatest strength. If the original 05 feels too bouncy and hard to tame, the FX version makes it much easier to place the ball exactly where you want it.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* The ball forms a high trajectory (High Arc) over the net. This provides immense psychological stability when lifting heavy backspin (chopped) balls, as the risk of hitting the net is significantly reduced.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky vs. Solid:** **Very Clicky.**
* It produces a distinct, crisp metallic sound ("Clang!") upon impact. This sound helps establish a good rhythm during play.


* **Dwell Time:** **Very Long**
* The ball doesn't just bounce off immediately; there is a distinct sensation of the ball sinking deep into the sponge before being catapulted out. The "hold and shoot" feeling is exceptional.



## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Overwhelming Drive Stability:** It is very easy to lift the ball and impart spin even from low or unstable positions.
* **Light Weight:** Ideal for those looking to reduce the overall weight of their racket, aiding in faster swing speeds.
* **Backhand Optimization:** It offers the perfect conditions for executing flicks or loop drives on the backhand side, where wrist power is often relatively weaker than the forehand.


* **Cons:**
* **Limit on Maximum Power:** Due to the soft sponge, the rubber may "bottom out" (sponge fully compresses) during very powerful smashes or drives, leading to a loss of power transfer.
* **Spin Sensitivity:** It is sensitive to the opponent's spin. You need to be careful with angle adjustments during service reception or blocking.
* **Durability:** Like the rest of the Tenergy series, the edges tend to crumble easily, and the lifespan is not particularly long.



## 6. Target Audience & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate Amateurs:** Players learning the feel of looping, or those who find the original Tenergy 05 too hard and burdensome.
* **Stable Connection Style:** Players who prefer winning points through rallies and placement rather than a single knockout shot.
* **Female Players:** Players who want to generate high spin and distance with less physical force.


* **Recommended Position:** **Backhand**
* *For Forehand use, it is suitable only for players who do not have a very strong impact.*


* **Similar Rubbers (Brand Alternatives):**
* **Tibhar:** Evolution FX-P (Similar hardness but slightly higher speed).
* **Donic:** Bluefire M3 or JP03 (Similar softness and spin-oriented nature).
* **Andro:** Rasanter R42 (A modern tension rubber with a soft feel).

**Coach's Tip:**
Tenergy 05 FX is a rubber that gives you **'Confidence'**. If you find yourself intimidated during games due to frequent drive errors, switching to this rubber alone can drastically increase the number of shots that successfully cross the net. However, be aware that if your impact is at a professional level, the ball might feel too "mushy" or uncontrolled.
