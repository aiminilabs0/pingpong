# Butterfly Dignics 05

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"Evolution beyond the legend, the absolute standard for modern table tennis counter drives."**

* **Style:** Aggressive Topspin
* **Overall Score:** **9.8** / 10

If Tenergy 05 was a "revolution of spin," Dignics 05 is the **"completion of spin and grip."** Adapted for the plastic ball era, it maximizes surface friction and improves sponge elasticity, generating immense spin even on thin contacts. Excluding the price barrier, it is undoubtedly one of the best rubbers in existence.

## 2. Key Specs Data

* **Hardness:** **40 degrees (Butterfly Standard)**
* *Note: When converted to the German ESN standard, this is equivalent to a hard sponge of approximately **50~52 degrees**.*


* **Weight:** **Somewhat Heavy** (Approx. 48~50g after cutting / based on standard head size)
* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Tokuatsu/Max)**
* *To truly experience the value of this rubber, a thick sponge is recommended to fully support your impact.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[9.5]** / 10
* Rather than simple rebound speed, the "power" released when the sponge (Spring Sponge X) compresses and expands upon impact is overwhelming. It provides sufficient flight distance even from mid-to-far distance.


* **Spin:** **[10]** / 10
* This is the reason for this rubber's existence. The top sheet's grip has improved dramatically, showing excellent ability to momentarily "bite" the ball. It guarantees top-tier spin rates for both loop drives and power drives.


* **Control:** **[8.0]** / 10
* Control is proportional to the user's skill. If the impact is precise, the ball lands exactly where intended, but with weak or vague impact, the probability of net errors or over-shooting increases. It is also difficult to receive serves as it is sensitive to incoming spin.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* It draws an arc similar to or higher than Tenergy 05. However, after the bounce, the ball tends to "kick" low and extend forward rather than popping up, making it difficult for the opponent to block.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Solid & Damp:**
* Instead of a light, clicky "clang" sound, it has a heavy **"thud" or "chwak"** feeling.


* **Extreme Grip:**
* The moment the ball touches the surface, the sensation of **grabbing it tight** without slipping is clearly transmitted to the fingertips. While the feeling of the ball sinking deep into the sponge (Dwell Time) might feel shorter than Tenergy 05, the surface grip compensates for this.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Overwhelming Counter Ability:** When returning an opponent's drive (counter-topspin), the ball does not get pushed back; instead, the rubber excels at overwriting the opponent's spin with your own.
* **Improved Durability:** The chronic issue of the existing Tenergy series, "sugar durability" (crumbling edges, surface wear), has been drastically improved, extending performance life by 1.5 to 2 times.
* **Versatility in Techniques:** It covers all ranges from modern short techniques like Chiquita, stops, and flicks to heavy power drives.

**Cons**

* **Wicked Price:** It is among the most expensive consumable rubbers, leading to a high maintenance cost.
* **High Skill Requirement:** If your impact is weak, you won't even extract 50% of the rubber's performance, and the ball may "die" (fall short).
* **Spin Sensitivity:** Because the surface grip is so good, it reacts sensitively to the opponent's serves or spin, requiring delicate racquet angle adjustments.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended User:**
* Intermediate to advanced club players and professionals.
* **Power Drive style** players who can generate solid impact with their own power.
* Players who enjoy counter-play close to the table or dominate rallies from mid-distance.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly recommended for powerful finishing shots and heavy spin.
* **Backhand:** For advanced players with good impact, it is also an excellent weapon for Chiquita and backhand drives.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly Tenergy 05 Hard:** Speed is slightly more direct than Dignics, but lifespan is shorter.
* **Tibhar Evolution MX-D:** Similar concept of a hard sponge and high spin; can be considered a cost-effective alternative.
* **Xiom Jekyll & Hyde H52.5:** Similar characteristics of high hardness, high repulsion, and high spin.
