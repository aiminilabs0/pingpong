# Butterfly Tenergy 80

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"The pinnacle of uncompromising balance, where Tenergy 05's spin meets Tenergy 64's speed."**

* **Overall Style:** All-round Offensive
* **Overall Score:** **9.5 / 10**
* Even though it has been on the market for some time, it remains a highly complete "hexagonal" balance rubber that is still considered a standard in the sport.



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:**
* **Butterfly Standard 36°** (Approx. **47.5°** when converted to the German ESN standard).
* It is neither too hard nor too soft, offering a hardness level with the least amount of dislike among players.


* **Weight:** **Standard**
* Approx. 46~48g after cutting (Standard head size).
* It is microscopically lighter than Tenergy 05 and slightly heavier than 64, but the difference is negligible in practice.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Tokubetsu/Max)**
* I recommend the thickest version to fully utilize the performance of the Spring Sponge.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[ 9.0 ] / 10**
* The ball rebound speed is faster than Tenergy 05. It offers a satisfying sensation where the ball shoots out cleanly during forward speed drives or smashes. It is less linear (straight) than Tenergy 64.


* **Spin:** **[ 9.0 ] / 10**
* While it doesn't have the overwhelming trajectory of the '05' series, it produces sufficiently threatening spin. Its **ability to grip the ball without slipping during counter-topspin rallies** is particularly excellent.


* **Control:** **[ 8.5 ] / 10**
* This is where this rubber truly shines. Compared to Tenergy 05, which is sensitive to spin, T80 is less affected by the opponent's spin, making it **much more stable in blocking and pushing (short game) battles**.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium**
* It sits exactly in the middle between the high arc of the 05 and the low trajectory of the 64. It draws a moderate arc, clearing the net reliably.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Sensation:** **Solid & Precise**
* The characteristic "wrapping" feel of the Spring Sponge is present, but it offers the pleasure of an instant reaction at the moment of impact.


* **Dwell Time:** **Medium**
* It feels like it holds the ball sufficiently upon impact before catapulting it out. It offers a feeling that makes it easiest for the user to send the ball exactly as intended. It feels "chewy/springy" rather than "mushy."



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Perfect Balance:** It demonstrates above-average performance in all techniques, including drives, smashes, blocks, and serves. It is a "Jack of all trades."
* **Backhand Stability:** It is the best alternative for enthusiasts who find Tenergy 05 too burdensome (due to over-mistakes or spin sensitivity) on the backhand.
* **Ease of Adaptation:** It pairs well with almost any blade (Carbon or All-wood) and is great for players transitioning from beginner to advanced levels.

**Cons**

* **High Price:** Due to Butterfly's premium pricing policy, the barrier to entry is high for users who prioritize cost-performance ratio.
* **Durability Issues:** It suffers from the chronic Tenergy series issue where the edges of the top sheet crumble or chip easily.
* **Lack of Distinct Personality:** Because the balance is *too* good, it may feel lacking in a specific "killer weapon" characteristic, unlike the extreme spin of T05 or the blazing speed of T64.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced Amateurs:** All-round players who value consistency and stability.
* **"Tenergy 05 Dropouts":** Players who struggled with control due to T05's high throw angle and spin sensitivity.
* **Style:** Two-winged looper (drive) or close-to-table fast attack styles.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **1st Choice: Backhand** - Optimized for stable blocking and fast-tempo backhand drives.
* **2nd Choice: Forehand** - Suitable for styles that mix smashes and drives.


* **Similar Rubbers (Other Brands):**
* **Tibhar:** Evolution MX-P (Similar nature, but feels slightly harder with a stronger click).
* **Andro:** Rasanter R47 (A balanced rubber focusing on rebound).
* **Donic:** Bluefire M2 (A classic masterpiece in a similar position).
