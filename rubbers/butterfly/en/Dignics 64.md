# Butterfly Dignics 64

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **One-Line Definition:** "Adding grip to overwhelming speed: The evolution of Tenergy 64 and the ultimate destination for speed-oriented rubbers."
* **Overall Style:** Speed Oriented / Close-to-table Fast Attack & Mid-distance Drive
* **Overall Score:** **9.1 / 10**

> **Review:** Dignics 64 is the rubber with the most excellent **'linear repulsion'** in the series. While maintaining the exhilarating speed shown by the existing Tenergy 64, it drastically improves the 'slippage' phenomenon by adding the unique surface grip of the Dignics line. It is the best choice for players who use smashes, energetic pushes, and fast-tempo drives.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **40 degrees** (Butterfly standard) / **Approx. 52~53 degrees** (Converted to ESN/German standard)
* *Note: Although the spec hardness is high, the feeling is softer than Dignics 05 due to the 'No. 64' pimple structure.*


* **Weight:** **Medium**
* *Approx. 46~48g after cutting (standard head size). It is not burdensome for a high-hardness rubber.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Tokuatsu / Max)**
* *The thickest version is recommended to maximize repulsion.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **9.8 / 10**
* The travel distance is very long, and the initial speed is explosive. It creates a high-speed ball that pierces deep into the opponent's court with relatively little force.


* **Spin:** **8.5 / 10**
* The absolute amount of spin is less than the '05' series, but thanks to the improved grip of the top sheet, you can generate much more powerful spin than the past Tenergy 64. The ball does not slip and extends forward well, especially in counter-topspin rallies.


* **Control:** **7.5 / 10**
* Because the repulsion is so strong, there is a high probability of over-hitting (long errors). Stability is better in aggressive flicks or pushes rather than delicate touch play (like short stops).


* **Throw Angle:** **Low**
* The ball travels low and fast, skimming over the net. It shows a sharp, direct trajectory rather than a stable, high arc.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky vs. Solid:** Very Clicky. It has a crisp and sharp feeling, like a "Clang!" sound upon impact.
* **Dwell Time:** **Short**
* While the 'Spring Sponge X' grabs the ball momentarily, the property of repelling it is stronger. The feeling is dominated by a quick **catapult** effect rather than holding the ball for a long time.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Overwhelming Speed:** Provides power to send the ball from mid-to-far distance without loss of force.
* **Improved Durability & Grip:** The short lifespan (chipping edges, surface wear) that was a disadvantage of the Tenergy series has been significantly improved with Dignics technology.
* **Excellent Blocking & Countering:** Optimized for countering with a fast rhythm while being less sensitive to the opponent's incoming spin.

**Cons**

* **High Price:** It belongs to the most expensive line of existing rubbers, making it less accessible.
* **Net Errors due to Low Trajectory:** It is easy to hit the net when executing loop drives if the racket angle is not adjusted correctly.
* **Impact Requirement:** With poor impact technique, the ball may just bounce off without spin, resulting in a 'floating' ball that goes long.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended User:**
1. **Intermediate to Advanced Players:** Those who can perform precise impact strokes.
2. **Backhand Punch/Push Style:** Players who repel the ball with a fast rhythm on the backhand.
3. **Smash & Drive Hybrid:** Players who prefer speed-oriented finishing shots over spin-oriented loops.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Backhand:** The most recommended position. It secures travel distance even with a short backswing and does not lose out in blocking/short battles.
* **Forehand:** Suitable for female amateurs who frequently mix in smashes or Penholder users.


* **Similar Rubbers (Alternatives):**
* **Butterfly Tenergy 64:** Choose if on a budget or if you want a slightly softer feel (Note: lifespan is shorter).
* **Andro Rasanter R48:** An ESN (German) rubber with fast speed and good click feel; similar characteristics.
