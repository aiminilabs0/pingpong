# Butterfly Tenergy 80 FX

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"Soft stability added to the perfect balance of Tenergy 05's spin and 64's speed."**

* **Style:** All-round Balance (Control & Spin)
* **Overall Score:** **9.2 / 10**
* It is a 'user-friendly high-performance rubber' that maintains the unique high performance of the Tenergy series while allowing users with weaker impact to easily extract 100% of its potential.



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **32 degrees (Butterfly Standard)** / Approx. 42~43 degrees (Converted to ESN/German Standard)
* *Note:* It adopts a very soft 'FX' sponge, offering a distinct plush feel when pressed with a finger.


* **Weight:** **Lightweight**
* It is noticeably lighter than the standard Tenergy 80. It is advantageous for those who want to reduce the total weight of their racket.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Thick)** or **Max**
* Because the sponge is soft, I recommend using a thicker sponge to prevent loss of flight distance, rather than a thin one.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **8.0 / 10**
* Thanks to the unique elasticity of the 'Spring Sponge', the ball shoots out briskly even with little force. However, with very strong impact, the sponge may compress too much (bottoming out), leading to energy loss, so it is not top-tier in terms of raw power.


* **Spin:** **8.8 / 10**
* It 'hugs' the ball deeply, making it very easy to generate spin on loops or connecting drives. While the *maximum* spin potential might be lower than Tenergy 05, the *ease of spin generation* is top-class.


* **Control:** **9.8 / 10**
* **The reason for this rubber's existence.** It is incredibly easy to control the ball during blocks, pushes, and short games. It provides exceptional stability when blocking an opponent's strong drive.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium**
* Lower than Tenergy 05 FX, but higher than 64 FX. It draws a moderate and consistent arc, drastically reducing net misses or over-hitting errors.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky:** Very clear and loud.
* Even with light contact, it produces a satisfying metallic "Click!" sound. The psychological satisfaction provided by the hitting sound is quite high.


* **Dwell Time:** **Long**
* The ball doesn't bounce off immediately upon contact; instead, there is a strong sensation of the ball digging deep into the sponge before being shot out (often described as "eating the ball"). This makes handling the ball into the desired course very smooth.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### Pros

* **Overwhelming Ease of Use:** Beginners, intermediates, or female players with weaker impact can easily experience Tenergy's unique performance.
* **Backhand Block Stability:** It is optimized for backhand defense, as it does not react sensitively to the opponent's spin but rather absorbs and returns the ball softly.
* **Lightweight:** Ideal for those concerned about elbow injuries due to heavy rackets or those wanting to increase swing speed.

### Cons

* **Power Ceiling:** When hit with professional-level strong impact, the sponge may compress to its limit (bottom out), causing the ball to die or fly unpredictably.
* **Lifespan & Durability:** Due to the soft sponge and topsheet characteristics, the rubber edges may crumble, or the sponge bubbles may lose elasticity faster than harder rubbers.
* **High Price:** The performance is certain, but the high price tag can still be a burden for users who prioritize value for money.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate players seeking Backhand stability:** Players who focus on connecting drives and blocking.
* **Players with weaker impact:** Female club players or juniors who want to generate speed and spin with less force.
* **Loop Drive Beginners:** Excellent training equipment for learning the sensation of "brushing/holding" the ball.


* **Recommended Position:** **Backhand (Highly Recommended)** / Forehand (For control-focused play)
* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Tibhar Evolution FX-P:** Has similar hardness and feeling, but the rebound is slightly more controlled/suppressed compared to Tenergy.
* **Andro Rasanter R42:** Similar in its soft feeling and fast speed.
* **Xiom Vega Europe:** Can be seen as a budget-friendly entry-level version; the characteristics are very similar.

**Coach's Tip:**

> "If your shots keep hitting the net, or your blocks fly out against strong incoming shots, **Tenergy 80 FX** can be an immediate solution. However, if you are a 'Power Drive' style player who finishes the point with one big shot, it is better to choose the normal Tenergy 80 or 05 rather than the FX version."
