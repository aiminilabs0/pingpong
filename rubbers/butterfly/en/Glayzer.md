# Butterfly Glayzer

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **Definition:** "The new 'standard' that puts the cutting-edge technology of Dignics into everyone's hands."
* **Style:** All-round Offensive
* **Overall Score:** **8.8 / 10**
> *Commentary: It is a 'high-performance entry' rubber designed to deliver about 80-90% of the performance of the flagship 'Dignics 05' while being much easier to handle. The balance between cost-effectiveness and performance is outstanding.*



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **38° (Butterfly Standard)**
* *Note: When converted to the German ESN standard (Tibhar, Andro, etc.), this equates to a medium-hard sponge of approximately **47.5° to 48°**.*


* **Weight:** **Medium**
* *After cutting (standard head size), it weighs around 46~48g. It is neither too light nor too heavy.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Max)** / **1.9mm**
* *For most offensive players, I recommend 2.1mm (Max).*



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[7.5] / 10**
* While the 'Spring Sponge X' provides good elasticity, it does not shoot off like a bullet (unlike Dignics 05 or Tenergy 64). It offers 'controllable speed' that honestly reflects the impact you put in.


* **Spin:** **[8.5] / 10**
* This is the rubber's greatest strength. The top sheet grips the ball exceptionally well, making it easy to generate spin even with imperfect technique. It creates a heavy ball quality that holds up well in topspin rallies.


* **Control:** **[9.0] / 10**
* Over-hitting errors are significantly reduced. When blocking a precise opponent's heavy spin, the rubber has excellent capability to absorb the energy and keep the ball low and on the table.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium-High**
* It draws a safe arc over the net. It aims for the trajectory of 'Dignics 05' but provides a slightly more stable and forgiving curve.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Sensation of Grey Spring Sponge X:**
The **Dwell Time** (how long the ball stays on the rubber) feels long. While the 'Rozena' felt somewhat dry or light, Glayzer offers a much more **dense, solid, and grippy** hand feeling.
* **Clicky vs. Solid:**
Rather than a sharp, metallic "Clang!" clicky sound, it feels closer to a "Thud/Poof"—a heavy sensation of wrapping around the ball before shooting it out.

## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Overwhelming Forgiveness:** It provides an 'automatic' sense of stability where the ball lands on the table even if your form is slightly off.
* **Democratization of Technology:** You can experience the 'Spring Sponge X' technology (used in the high-end Dignics line) at a reasonable price.
* **Durability:** The durability of the top sheet has been improved, showing less surface wear compared to the Tenergy series.


* **Cons:**
* **Lack of "One-Shot" Power:** For advanced players with very strong impact, the maximum distance and destructive power may feel lacking.
* **Ambiguous Positioning:** It is a bit pricey for beginners but lacks the raw power for elite players, making it potentially awkward for those outside the "Intermediate" range.
* **Humidity Sensitivity:** Like many Butterfly rubbers, it retains some sensitivity to humidity, potentially reducing spin on very humid days.



## 6. Recommended Users & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Beginner/Intermediate players** who have taken lessons for over a year and are solidifying their topspin drive strokes.
* **Advanced amateurs** who find 'Tenergy 05' or 'Dignics 05' too bouncy and difficult to control.
* **All-round players** who prefer stable rallies and connecting plays.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly recommended for intermediates learning the feeling of looping/driving.
* **Backhand:** Recommended for advanced players seeking stability in blocking and opening loops.


* **Similar Rubbers (Other Brands):**
* **Xiom:** Vega X – Similar balance of cost-performance and stability.
* **Tibhar:** Evolution EL-D – Similar modern sponge technology and control balance.

**Analyst's Suggestion:**
Do you happen to know the model of the blade (racket) you are currently using? Glayzer creates the best synergy when combined with **carbon blades that have good repulsion** (e.g., Timo Boll ALC, Viscaria, etc.), as the blade compensates for the rubber's slight lack of raw power.
