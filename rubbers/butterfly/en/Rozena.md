# Butterfly Rozena

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"The perfect bridge to Tenergy, the aesthetics of 'Tolerance' that forgives your mistakes."**

Rozena was created for players who aspire to the high performance of Butterfly's flagship 'Tenergy' series but lack the impact skill to handle it effectively. Rather than explosive power, it focuses on **the stability to return the ball over the net in any posture.**

* **Style:** Balanced (All-round Offensive)
* **Overall Score:** 8.8 / 10
* *The balance between cost-performance and actual performance is excellent.*



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **35 degrees (Butterfly Standard)**
* *Note:* When converted to the standard ESN (German) scale, it feels like approximately **45 to 47.5 degrees**. The sponge pores are large, making it feel slightly softer than the numerical value suggests.


* **Weight:** **Medium**
* It weighs about **46~48g** when cut for a standard head size. It is heavier than lightweight beginner rubbers but lighter than high-hardness professional rubbers.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Tokuatsu / Max)**
* I recommend the thickest version to fully experience the 'Spring Sponge' effect.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0-10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[7.5] / 10**
* The trajectory length is not excessively long; it is quite moderate. The ball travels honestly relative to the power you put in, resulting in fewer over-hit errors. It lacks the "bullet-like" speed of Tenergy 64 or Dignics.


* **Spin:** **[8.5] / 10**
* Butterfly's signature **'Spring Sponge'** is applied, providing excellent ability to "catch" the ball. When playing topspin (loops), the ball doesn't slip and generates a heavy, rotation-rich shot.


* **Control:** **[9.5] / 10**
* This is the reason for this rubber's existence. Butterfly's **'Tolerance'** technology is applied, meaning that even if your swing trajectory or racket angle is slightly unstable, it has an outstanding ability to steer the ball onto the table.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium-High**
* The ball draws a stable arc (parabola) over the net rather than piercing in a straight line. It offers a very comfortable trajectory for loop/drive players.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Solid over Clicky:** Instead of the clear "click" sound typical of German (ESN) rubbers, it has a **"solid yet chewy/grippy"** sensation where the ball digs deep into the rubber before catapulting out.
* **Dwell Time:** Long. The ball stays on the racket for a significant amount of time, allowing the user to clearly feel the feedback of "holding and hitting" the ball. This is excellent for developing touch.

## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Overwhelming Stability:** It drastically reduces unforced errors even from disadvantageous positions or off-center hits.
* **Ease of Adaptation:** It offers the smoothest transition when upgrading from low-cost rubbers to high-performance tension rubbers.
* **Brand Reliability:** It uses the same 'Spring Sponge' technology as Tenergy but at a relatively more affordable price point.

### **Cons**

* **Ceiling on Max Power:** When an advanced player hits with full impact, the ball may lack the punch and extension compared to Tenergy 05 or Dignics 09c.
* **Durability Issues:** Like many Butterfly rubbers, it can be prone to "chipping" around the edges of the rubber over time.
* **Weight Perception:** For absolute beginners, it might feel heavier than expected.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
1. **Beginner to Intermediate Loopers:** Amateurs who have started lessons and are learning topspin drives.
2. **Stable Backhand Seekers:** Intermediate-Advanced players who use a powerful rubber on the forehand but want to increase block and rally consistency on the backhand.
3. **Juniors/Female Players:** Those who want to generate spin easily with less physical force.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Backhand:** Highly recommended. It is excellent for resolving insecurity in backhand strokes.
* **Forehand:** Suitable for beginners to intermediates. (Advanced players may find it slightly lacking in power for the forehand).


* **Similar Rubbers (Alternatives):**
* **Xiom Vega X:** Slightly harder and more "clicky" than Rozena, with great cost-performance.
* **Tibhar Evolution EL-P:** Similar hardness and spin potential, but with slightly higher rebound speed.
