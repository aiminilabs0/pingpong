# Butterfly Dignics 80

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **Defining this rubber in one sentence:**

> **"The golden ratio of speed and spin; the ultimate weapon for the versatile all-round player."**

* **Overall Review:**
This model strikes a perfect balance between the overwhelming rotational power of Dignics 05 and the high speed of Dignics 64. Applied with the 'Spring Sponge X' technology, it demonstrates a level of power a step above the existing Tenergy 80. It is suitable for advanced players who desire flawless play in offense, defense, and rallies without any gaps.
* **Style:** All-round Offensive (Balance / Offensive)
* **Overall Score:** **9.6** / 10

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **40 degrees** (Butterfly standard)
* *Note: Based on the German ESN standard (Omega, Evolution, etc.), this corresponds to a hard sponge of approximately **53 degrees**.*


* **Weight:** **Heavy side** (Estimated 48~50g after cutting)
* **Recommended Thickness:** 2.1mm or MAX

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed: [9.3]/10**
* The repulsion has been improved compared to the Tenergy series. The initial speed upon impact is very fast, and the travel distance remains substantial even from mid-to-far distance.


* **Spin: [9.2]/10**
* While the absolute maximum spin is slightly lower than Dignics 05, the pimple structure makes it **easier to set the racket angle.** The spin generated during rallies is top-tier.


* **Control: [8.8]/10**
* Despite being a high-hardness rubber, it is less sensitive to the opponent's incoming spin compared to the 05, providing excellent stability in blocking and short play.


* **Throw Angle: Medium**
* Lower than 05 but higher than 64. The ball doesn't pop up too high but creates a moderate arc over the net, making it ideal for users who mix smashes and loop drives.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Solid but Grippy:**
* The sponge is very hard, but the top sheet has excellent **"ball-grabbing"** sensation.
* While the existing Tenergy 80 focused on a "clicky" feel, Dignics 80 has a stronger sensation of the ball **"holding deeply (Dwell Time) before shooting out."**
* If the impact is weak, it may just feel hard; however, with proper impact, you can experience the chewy elasticity unique to Spring Sponge X.



## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Overwhelming Versatility:** It performs above average regardless of the technique used—drives, smashes, blocks, or Chiquita flicks.
* **Improved Durability:** Compared to the Tenergy series, where the surface wore out quickly, top sheet durability has increased significantly.
* **Counter Drives:** It holds the opponent's ball well, resulting in a very high success rate when executing counter-topspins close to the table.


* **Cons:**
* **High Price:** It is in the most expensive price range in the table tennis rubber market, making it less accessible.
* **Impact Requirement:** Due to the high hardness, if used by beginners or players with weak impact, the ball may tend to dump into the net ("die").
* **Weight:** It can be a burdensome weight for users who prefer a lightweight setup.



## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Mid-to-advanced level amateurs and players.**
* Those who find the spin sensitivity of Dignics 05 burdensome or the ball slippage of Dignics 64 undesirable.
* All-round players who transition quickly between forehand and backhand and mix various techniques.


* **Recommended Position:** **Backhand** (Highly Recommended) / Forehand is also fine
* *Coach's Tip:* This will be the best choice for those who want to capture both the stability of blocking and the power of Chiquita on the backhand.


* **Similar Rubbers (Alternatives):**
* **Butterfly Tenergy 80:** When you want a slightly softer and lighter feel than Dignics.
* **Tibhar Evolution MX-P:** A high-performance German rubber with good cost-performance (Feel is different, but positioning is similar).
