# Butterfly Tenergy 05

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Verdict

> **"Table tennis history is divided into pre- and post-Tenergy 05. The absolute monarch of overwhelming spin."**

* **Style:** Close-to-table & Mid-distance Topspin Attack (OFF+)
* **Overall Score:** **9.8 / 10** (Performance is near perfect, but the score reflects the high price and difficulty of use)

**Verdict:**
Even after more than 15 years since its release, it is still called the textbook of "Spin-oriented High Tension Rubbers." Its unique 'Spring Sponge' technology provides a sensation of holding the ball deep before catapulting it with explosive spin. In modern table tennis, if you are a Looper (Topspin attacker) who prioritizes **'Spin'**, this is a gateway rubber you must experience at least once.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **36° (Butterfly Standard)**
* *Analyst Note:* 36 degrees on the Butterfly scale converts to approximately **47.5° to 48°** on the German (ESN) scale. It provides a firm click feel—neither too hard nor too soft.


* **Weight:** **Heavy**
* It weighs around 50g after cutting (based on a standard shakehand head size), which puts some burden on the wrist.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm (Tokuatsu / Max)**
* To extract 100% of Tenergy 05's performance, the thickest version is recommended.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0-10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **8.5 / 10**
* Rather than pure initial speed off the paddle, the "kick" (speed after bouncing on the opponent's table) is threatening. While not as fast as the latest ESN rubbers in terms of initial velocity, its energy transfer efficiency is perfect.


* **Spin:** **10 / 10**
* The reason for this rubber's existence. The combination of the specific pimple geometry and the Spring Sponge creates tremendous rotation without the ball slipping, even on thin brush contacts.


* **Control:** **7.0 / 10**
* It reflects the user's skill honestly. While the spin you generate is powerful, it is also **extremely sensitive to the opponent's spin**. Therefore, precise angle adjustments are required for receiving services or blocking.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* The ball draws a high parabolic arc over the net.  This high trajectory secures a "safety margin" that reduces net errors, allowing for bold and powerful loop drives.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Unrivaled 'Hold' Sensation:**
The **Dwell Time** (the time the ball stays on the rubber) is long; upon impact, the ball feels like it digs deep into the sponge before shooting out. This gives the user confidence that they are dominating the ball.
* **Distinct Clicky Feel:**
It is not mushy or dull. When the impact is correct, there is a clear vibration transmitted to the fingertips. It is the definitive rubber for what players describe as "biting the ball."

## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Overwhelming Spin Performance:** Delivers top-tier performance in all spin-based techniques, including service, loop drives, and kill shots.
* **High Arc & Stability:** Creates a trajectory where the ball easily clears the net and drops sharply near the opponent's end line.
* **Excellent Durability:** While the sponge bubbles may eventually break, the topsheet maintains its grip/friction for a very long time compared to other brands.

### **Cons**

* **Spin Sensitivity:** Because it reacts heavily to the opponent's service or topspin, the ball will fly off unpredictably if the angle is slightly off. (The main reason it is not recommended for beginners).
* **Weight:** Attaching it to both sides can make the racket heavy, potentially slowing down swing speed.
* **Price:** It belongs to the most expensive line of table tennis rubbers, which can be a burden for maintenance costs.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended User:**
* **Intermediate to Pro:** Users who can generate spin with proper impact.
* **Style:** **Power Looper** aiming for points with topspin drives from close to mid-distance.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Most commonly used on the forehand for powerful kill shots and continuous loops.
* **Backhand:** Recommended for high-level players with strong impact and backhand loop capabilities.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Tibhar Evolution MX-P:** Famous as a rival to Tenergy 05; slightly faster with better cost-performance.
* **Butterfly Dignics 05:** The upgraded version of Tenergy 05; enhanced speed and longevity, but the feeling is slightly harder.
* **Xiom Omega VII Pro:** A masterpiece from a Korean brand with a good balance of spin and speed, featuring a nice clicky feel.
