### 1. Official Product Description

This rubber is a **slightly tacky hybrid rubber** incorporating Xiom's latest technology and is part of the series (Hugo Edition) used by Brazilian table tennis star **Hugo Calderano**.

* **Core Technology (X-Factor & Dual Tension):**
* It features the world's first **'Dual Tension'** technology, which creates a powerful tension effect without the need for boosting. Xiom calls this the 'X-Factor,' providing high repulsion straight out of the package without additional tuning.


* **Structural Features:**
* **Top Sheet:** It has a **slightly tacky** surface similar to Chinese rubbers but combined with the speed of tension rubbers. The top sheet is thick, and the pimples are short and densely arranged, offering an intuitive feel and strong energy transfer upon impact.
* **Sponge (Epsilon Sponge):** It uses a high-hardness **52.5-degree** Carbo sponge (black). The pores are small and evenly distributed to minimize energy loss during impact.


* **AI Technology:** Designed using AI to calculate the optimal spin and trajectory (Cycloid technology).
* **Target Play:** Engineered to satisfy both precise short games near the table and powerful drive attacks from mid-to-far distances.

### 2. User Reviews Synthesis

This is a summary of pros, cons, and characteristics based on real user reviews from internet communities (table tennis forums, etc.).

#### **Feel & Performance**

* **Balance of Spin and Speed:** Many users say it "shoots out quite well despite being a tacky rubber." It sits in the same hybrid position as Butterfly's 'Dignics 09c', but it is **less sticky than the 09c and has stronger repulsion (catapult effect), giving it a refreshing, shooting feel.**
* **Feel:** Despite the high 52.5-degree sponge, the actual feel is "not as hard as expected, with a clear click (feeling of the ball biting)." The consensus is that it is definitely easier to handle and more forgiving than the C55.0 (55-degree) version.
* **Trajectory (Arc):** The ball trajectory tends to be **low, long, and linear**. It creates a shot that sharply crosses the net rather than drawing a high, safe arc.

#### **Pros**

* **Value for Money:** Users praise its excellent value, offering a similar high-performance hybrid feel at about half the price of its main competitor, 'Dignics 09c'.
* **Short Game (Touch Play):** Thanks to the tacky surface, stability in short techniques like serves, stops, and pushes is excellent.
* **Power:** When hit with proper impact, the speed and spin are comparable to top-tier rubbers.

#### **Cons**

* **Durability:** This is the most frequently mentioned drawback. Users note that performance degradation (wear on the top sheet, loss of tackiness) happens somewhat faster compared to the Dignics series.
* **Weight:** Due to the high hardness, it is **on the heavier side**. Managing the total racket weight may be necessary if attached to both sides.
* **Difficulty:** While it has good speed, it is fundamentally a hard tacky rubber. Beginners with insufficient impact might find the ball dumping into the net or difficult to control.

#### **Comparison Summary (vs. Dignics 09c)**

* **Dignics 09c:** Stronger tackiness, holds the ball longer before releasing, higher and more stable arc, longer lifespan.
* **Jekyll & Hyde C52.5:** Less tackiness, faster initial speed and better repulsion, lower and more linear trajectory, significantly cheaper price.

### **3. Conclusion & Recommendation**

The **Xiom Jekyll & Hyde C52.5** is highly recommended for **"intermediate to advanced players who find the price of Dignics 09c burdensome but are looking for a high-performance sticky tension rubber with similar characteristics."** It is particularly a suitable choice for those who want powerful shots and spin but find ultra-hard rubbers (55 degrees or higher) too demanding to control.
