### 1. Product Description

The **Jekyll & Hyde** series is a concept rubber designed to challenge the conventional wisdom that opposing properties (Speed vs. Control, Spin vs. Power) cannot coexist, aiming to implement both elements at a top-tier level simultaneously. Among them, the **X Series** focuses specifically on **'Power' and 'Catapult'.**

* **Key Technology (Power & Catapult):**
* **X (E-X-plosion):** The X47.5 applies a **'Sling' mechanism** where the rubber holds the ball deep and then shoots it out powerfully.
* Upon strong impact, the ball embeds deeply into the rubber surface, transferring explosive energy as it rebounds to create a powerful topspin.
* It is designed to effectively transfer both vertical and horizontal energy simultaneously.


* **Specs:**
* **Hardness:** 47.5 degrees (Medium Hard)
* **Manufacturing:** Germany (ESN)
* **Weight:** Approx. 51g (±2g) after cutting (based on standard head size)

### 2. Comprehensive User Reviews (Summary of Internet Feedback)

Synthesizing actual user reviews, the dominant opinion is that it is **"faster and more linear than the V47.5, an aggressive rubber with excellent repulsion."**

#### ✅ Pros

* **Excellent Speed and Repulsion:** Many users evaluate that the ball **travels faster** than the V47.5 of the same hardness. The power with which the ball bounces off (Catapult effect) upon impact is excellent, providing a crisp and refreshing feeling.
* **Linear and Sharp Trajectory:** The arc of the ball is somewhat lower and extends longer compared to the V series. This creates a ball quality that is difficult for opponents to time or block.
* **Convenience in Blocking and Short Game:** It is relatively less sensitive to the opponent's spin, making blocks or shorts (pushes) stable. The ball often stays low and skids on the table, leading to high scoring potential.
* **Strength in Smashing and Driving:** It demonstrates great destructive power not only in loop drives but also in flat hitting techniques (smashing).

#### ⚠️ Cons & Preferences (Ho-Bul-Ho)

* **Control Difficulty:** Due to the strong repulsion, "over-misses" (ball going off the table) can occur. While the V47.5 feels like it "holds the ball stably," the X47.5 feels like it "holds and then quickly shoots," so adaptation may be required.
* **Difference in Spin Generation:** It's not that it doesn't generate spin, but it is better suited for **drives that hit through the ball thickly** rather than the style of catching the ball thin for high loops (like the V47.5). Players who use a thin brushing technique might feel like the ball is slipping.
* **Feeling:** There are opinions that despite being 47.5 degrees, it feels slightly harder due to the high repulsion.

#### 🆚 Comparison: V47.5 vs. X47.5

* **V47.5:** **Balance Type.** Holds the ball stably and is suitable for spin-oriented play. (Focus on consistency/connection).
* **X47.5:** **Power Type.** Suitable for play focused on speed and distance. (Focus on finishing power and fast rallies).

### 3. Overall Recommendation

The **XIOM Jekyll & Hyde X47.5** is recommended for the following players:

1. **Close-to-Table Fast Attackers:** Players who handle the ball with a fast tempo close to the table or enjoy counter-driving after blocking.
2. **Players wanting to boost power:** Those who want to increase distance and speed using the rubber's own repulsion, even with weaker impact.
3. **Backhand Rubber:** Many club players use it for the backhand due to its moderate hardness, good blocking ability, and sharpness in backhand pushes or flicks.

**One-Line Summary:**

> "If you want **faster and more linear aggression** than the V47.5, this is a top choice; however, if you prefer stable connections and loop drives, some adaptation will be necessary."
