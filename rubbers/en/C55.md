### **1. Product Overview**

This rubber is famous for being the actual product currently used by world-class table tennis player **Hugo Calderano** on both sides (Forehand/Backhand).

* **Core Concept (Dual Tension):** True to the name 'Jekyll & Hyde,' it captures conflicting elements simultaneously—such as Spin vs. Speed and Tackiness (Stickiness) vs. Repulsion.
* **Specs:**
* **Hardness:** 55.0 degrees (Hard Sponge).
* **Technology:** **X-Factor** (Delivers powerful performance without additional boosting), **Epsilon Sponge** (Small, uniform pores for maximized energy transfer).


* **Key Features:**
* **Slightly Tacky Top Sheet:** Instead of the extreme stickiness of Chinese rubbers, it applies an 'optimized slight tackiness.' This maintains the grip to hold the ball while maximizing repulsion speed.
* **Power:** It provides a trajectory that extends all the way to the end of the table without the ball dropping early, even during mid-to-far distance drives.
* **Control:** It offers an intuitive feel when executing short techniques (like stops) near the net.

### **2. Comprehensive User Reviews (Community & YouTube Feedback)**

This is a summary of real user evaluations from internet communities (Tak9.com, XIOM store reviews, international forums, etc.).

#### **A. Feel (Impact)**

* **Softer than the specified hardness:** Although the sponge hardness is a very stiff 55 degrees, many reviews state that in actual play, **it feels closer to 52~53 degrees**. This is due to the flexible top sheet and the sponge's pore technology, which allows the ball to sink in deeply.
* **Click Sound:** There is significant praise for the crisp, metallic 'click' sound upon impact. It provides a hitting sensation similar to a well-boosted rubber.

#### **B. Performance**

* **The Complete Hybrid:** Among hybrid rubbers that mix the advantages of Chinese (sticky) and German (tension) rubbers, this is classified as a **slightly tacky rubber with a strong tension bias**.
* **Spin and Power:** It has excellent ability to 'catch' the ball upon impact, creating a heavy, spin-loaded ball quality. It is particularly noted for not losing out in counter-topspin rallies.
* **Ease of Control:** Despite being a high-hardness rubber, it is not difficult to use. Many club players who found top-tier rubbers like *Dignics 09C* too hard or burdensome to impact properly often evaluate this as "much easier to use."

#### **C. Comparisons (Vs. Other Products)**

* **vs. Butterfly Dignics 09C:** Many users compare it as an alternative to the 09C. The consensus is that C55.0 has **slightly better repulsion (bounce) and a softer feel, making it easier to handle**. However, opinions suggest that durability is better on the 09C.
* **vs. Hurricane 3 (Chinese Rubber):** It is less tacky than the Hurricane, but because the ball travels much faster without boosting, it feels less foreign for users transitioning from Chinese rubbers.

#### **D. Drawbacks & Points of Note**

* **Weight:** As expected of a high-hardness rubber, it is on the heavier side (requires attention to the total weight setup of the racket).
* **Durability:** While performance retention is decent, some opinions suggest that the micro-tackiness of the top sheet or the surface wears down slightly faster than its competitor (09C).
