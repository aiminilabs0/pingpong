This is the latest model carrying on the lineage of XIOM’s best-selling **Sigma** series. It retains the series’ trademark power while reducing weight and reinforcing spin.

### 2. Performance Analysis (User Review Summary)

User feedback can be summarized as **“An all-round power rubber that adds modern stability to classic Sigma power.”**

| Category | Detailed Evaluation |
| --- | --- |
| **Speed & Power** | **Excellent.** The Sigma series’ direct, linear speed is still here. The ball shoots off the racket quickly on impact, and it has plenty of length and power even from mid-distance. |
| **Spin** | Thanks to Dynamic Friction, it has strong **grip** and holds the ball well. If Sigma 2 leaned more toward speed, Sigma 5 noticeably reinforces spin, producing a stable, arcing trajectory on loop drives. |
| **Control & Feel** | Despite the 47.5° hardness, the feel is **clear and crisp** (a clicky feel). It’s easy to place the ball as intended. Some compare it to **Omega V Pro**, but say Sigma 5 feels a bit more refined and easier to handle. |
| **Weight** | It is **definitely lighter** than the previous models. Even when used on both sides, total racket weight feels more manageable, enabling faster forehand/backhand transitions. |

### 3. Summary of Pros & Cons

**✅ Pros**

* **Excellent balance:** Speed, spin, and control are very well balanced for a 47.5° rubber.
* **Easy to adapt:** With a standard hardness that’s neither too hard nor too soft, it’s an easy upgrade for players coming from rubbers like **Vega Pro** or **Omega IV/V Asia**.
* **Great value:** Cheaper than top flagship lines (e.g., Jekyll & Hyde), yet more than capable for high-level club play.

**❌ Cons**

* **Can feel “in-between”:** For players seeking extreme one-shot power, it may feel a bit tame; for true beginners, it can still be too bouncy/reactive.
* **No tackiness:** Unlike today’s semi-tacky trend (e.g., Jekyll & Hyde C series), this is a traditional tension rubber, so don’t expect the tricky ball behavior typical of tacky rubbers.
