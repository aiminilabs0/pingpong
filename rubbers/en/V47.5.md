### 1. Product Description

The name **"Jekyll & Hyde"** implies that two performance attributes often considered incompatible (Speed and Control, or Distance and Spin) have been successfully implemented together at the highest level.

* **Key Technology (V Technology):**
* Generally, when a rubber's repulsion (bounciness) increases, the ball's "dwell time" on the surface decreases, making it harder to generate spin.
* The **'V' Technology** applied to this product maximizes **'Ball Dragging'** capability—allowing the rubber to grip and carry the ball—while still delivering strong repulsive energy. This ensures stable trajectory and control even at high speeds.


* **Specs:**
* **Hardness:** 47.5° (Standard hardness for competitive sponges)
* **Colors:** Magenta (Pinkish), Black
* **Origin:** Made in Germany (ESN)


* **Features:**
* **Dual Performance:** Pursues a balance between aggressive speed and precise control.
* **Vivid Color:** In addition to standard Red/Black, the unique 'Magenta' color option allows players to express their style.

### 2. User Reviews Summary

This is a synthesis of actual performance feedback from domestic and international table tennis communities.

#### **Feel & Hardness**

* **Harder than expected:** While the stated hardness is 47.5°, many users feel it plays slightly firmer (closer to 50°) during actual play.
* **Click Feel:** When the ball is impacted correctly, it offers an excellent "clicking" sensation with a crisp sound as the ball shoots off.

#### **Performance (Speed & Spin)**

* **Speed-Oriented:** It receives higher marks for speed and repulsion than for spin. It is favored by players who like the ball to shoot out quickly, similar to the Tenergy 64 or 80 series.
* **Intuitive (Linear) Repulsion:** It behaves calmly on soft touches but explodes with speed on strong hits. This "linear" characteristic makes power control intuitive.
* **Spin:** It is not a tacky rubber that grabs the ball on the surface. Spin is generated best when driving "thickly" (driving the ball deep into the sponge) rather than thin brushing contact.

#### **Control & Trajectory**

* **Low Trajectory:** The ball creates a low, long trajectory rather than a high arc.
* **Strong in Blocks & Shorts:** Because it is less sensitive to incoming spin, it is very stable for blocking (defense) and backhand short exchanges.
* **Short Game:** Users report good control for net-play techniques like short pushes and flicks.

#### **Recommendations**

* **👍 Recommended for:**
* **Backhand Rubber:** Excellent for backhand drives or punches due to the low trajectory and fast speed.
* **Smashers / Thick Drive Players:** Amateurs who prefer hitting/driving the ball squarely.
* **Style Seekers:** Those who want to customize their racket with the vibrant Magenta color.


* **👎 Not Recommended for:**
* Players who primarily use thin, brushing loop drives.
* Players who prefer a high arc (trajectory) for safety over the net.



**One-Line Summary:**

> **"A firm, high-performance German rubber that excels in speed and low trajectory—perfect for backhand or smashing styles—while adding a unique touch with its Magenta color."**
