# Jekyll & Hyde C55

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"Realizing the impossible coexistence: The overwhelming spin of Chinese sticky rubbers met with the explosive speed of German tension rubbers."**

* **Style:** Power & Spin Aggressive
* **Overall Score:** **9.3** / 10.0
* *Comment:* It has perfectly erased the disadvantage of "slow speed" found in traditional sticky rubbers. Provided your impact is sufficient, it delivers top-tier performance among currently available rubbers.



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **55.0 degrees** (ESN Standard)
* *Note:* While the number suggests it is extremely hard, the actual feeling on impact is closer to **52~53 degrees** due to the use of a sponge with large pores.


* **Weight:** **Heavy** (Approx. 50g~53g after cutting)
* *Caution:* It is heavier than standard tension rubbers, so attention must be paid to the overall racket balance.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **MAX (2.1mm)**
* *Reason:* Recommended to maximize the synergy between the sticky top sheet and the high-hardness sponge.



## 3. Performance Analysis (Scale of 0~10)

* **Speed:** **[9.0] / 10**
* Unlike typical Chinese rubbers (e.g., Neo Hurricane), the ball travels well even with weaker impact. With ESN technology integrated, flight distance is sufficient, and there is no lack of power during smashes.


* **Spin:** **[9.6] / 10**
* **The reason for this rubber's existence.** During topspin (loops/drives), the ball feels like it sticks to the surface before shooting out, creating a heavy ball quality. The "Kick" (acceleration after the bounce) on the opponent's side is exceptional.


* **Control:** **[8.2] / 10**
* Despite the high repulsion, the sticky surface ensures the ball **does not pop up and stays short** during touch play (stops, pushes), offering excellent control.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* The ball draws a high arc over the net. This reduces net errors and makes it advantageous for landing the ball deep into the opponent's court.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Feeling Type:** **Solid & Deep Grip**
* **Detailed Description:**
* Rather than a sharp "Clicky" sound, it has a strong **"Thud" sensation that deeply grabs the ball.**
* Despite the 55-degree hardness, the large pores of the sponge (Open Pore) allow the ball to dig deep into the rubber upon impact, resulting in a **very long Dwell Time.**
* The heavy vibration felt at the fingertips when the impact is precise is very attractive.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Overwhelming Spin Performance:** Demonstrates top-class spin levels in both thin-brush loops and thick-impact drives.
* **Stability in Short Game:** Thanks to the tackiness, short service returns or stop shots do not float and stay low.
* **Price-to-Performance:** delivers performance similar to its competitor, Butterfly's D09C, but with better price accessibility.

**Cons**

* **Weight Burden:** If attached to both sides, the racket can become quite heavy, requiring sufficient physical strength.
* **Impact Requirement:** If the user's swing speed and impact are weak, it is difficult to extract 100% of the rubber's performance (especially the sponge's elasticity).
* **Humidity Sensitivity:** Like all sticky rubbers, surface friction can decrease on very humid days, leading to potential slippage.

## 6. Recommended Target & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced Players:** Players who know how to "brush" the ball with their own swing.
* **One-Shot Drive Style:** Attackers who want to pressure opponents with heavy ball quality.
* Existing Chinese rubber users craving more speed, or German tension rubber users desiring more powerful spin.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly Recommended. Optimal for creating finishing shots.
* **Backhand:** Recommended only for elite-level users with strong impact (may be too demanding for average club players).


* **Similar Rubbers (Comparison):**
* **Butterfly Dignics 09C:** The benchmark for C55. Performance is similar, but C55 feels slightly more intuitive in speed.
* **Tibhar Hybrid K3:** Very similar concept to C55. As K3 has issues with shorter durability, C55 may be advantageous in terms of lifespan.
