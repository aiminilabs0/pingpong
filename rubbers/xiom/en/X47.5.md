# Jekyll & Hyde X47.5

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"A masterclass in balance: Awakening your instincts for both explosive power and delicate control."**

* **Type:** Offensive Balanced (OFF)
* **Overall Score:** **8.8** / 10
* *Analyst's Comment:* This is the "no-fail choice" for advanced club players or intermediate players developing their impact, especially for those who find the pro-level H52.5 or Z52.5 versions too demanding.



## 2. Key Specifications

* **Hardness:** 47.5° (ESN scale / Medium-Hard)
* **Weight:** **Average** (Approx. 48g–50g after cutting)
* *Note:* Lighter than the high-hardness versions in the same series, but possesses a "dense" feel typical of modern tensor rubbers.


* **Recommended Thickness:** MAX (or 2.1mm)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0–10 Scale)

* **Speed: [8.5]/10**
* The 'X' series from XIOM features an excellent catapult effect. When you hit with proper impact, the ball depth is impressive, and the initial velocity is fast enough for aggressive close-to-the-table play.


* **Spin: [9.0]/10**
* The topsheet grip is outstanding. Even on thin-contact brush loops, the ball doesn't slip and bites into the rubber reliably. It offers not just a high "ceiling" for spin, but also makes the process of generating spin very easy.


* **Control: [8.5]/10**
* Thanks to the 47.5° hardness, the stability during blocking is superb. It provides a predictable response when neutralizing an opponent's heavy topspin or placing the ball into tight angles.


* **Throw Angle: Medium-High**
* It creates a stable arc that clears the net with plenty of margin. Rather than a flat trajectory, the ball follows a heavy, diving curve that kicks deep on the opponent's side.



## 4. Feeling

* **Clicky Feeling:** **Distinct.**
* There is a clear "ping" or metallic sound upon impact. This provides excellent auditory feedback, letting the player know they’ve hit the sweet spot.


* **Grip & Dwell Time:** **Long.**
* The sensation of the ball "sinking" into the rubber is excellent. Despite the 47.5° rating, the sponge feels forgiving during high-impact shots, hugging the ball before propelling it forward.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Ease of Looping:** Very low stress when lifting heavy underspin (backspin). The "biting" sensation increases the success rate of slow, heavy loops.
* **Perfect Balance:** It doesn't sacrifice speed for spin or vice versa, making it ideal for continuous topspin rallies.
* **Zero Adaptation Period:** Players coming from Tenergy 05, Omega 7, or Tibhar MX-P will feel at home immediately.

### **Cons**

* **Power Ceiling for Pros:** For elite players with extremely high impact, the sponge might feel slightly soft, leading to a "bottoming out" sensation (in which case, 50°+ is recommended).
* **Durability:** Like most high-performance ESN rubbers, the edges may chip over time, and the "peak" tension performance fades after heavy use.
* **Moisture Sensitivity:** Because the topsheet is so grippy, it can become slightly sensitive to high humidity, affecting spin consistency on rainy days.

## 6. Target Audience & Combinations

* **Recommended Players:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced Club Players:** Those looking to refine their loop feel and rally consistency.
* **Backhand Loopers:** An excellent choice for those who want to play aggressive backhand topspins or maintain a rock-solid block.
* **Female Players:** Highly recommended as a forehand rubber due to its manageable weight and helpful catapult.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Best:** **Backhand**
* **Good:** Forehand (for stability-oriented offensive players)


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Nittaku:** Fastarc G-1 (X47.5 is slightly faster and softer-feeling)
* **Tibhar:** Evolution MX-P / EL-P (X47.5 is easier to handle than MX-P, but more powerful than EL-P)
* **Andro:** Rasanter R48 (R48 feels slightly "plusher," while X47.5 has a clearer click)

**[Coach's Tip]**
When using the Jekyll & Hyde X47.5, the key is to **swing through the ball with confidence.** Don't just "poke" at it; trust the grip of the topsheet and follow through. That is when the "Jekyll" (the aggressive side) truly comes alive.
