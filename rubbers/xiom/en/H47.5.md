# Jekyll & Hyde H47.5

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"Extreme spin and a stable trajectory—an 'all-round cheat key' for topspin loop players."**

* **Style:** Balanced Offensive (Control-based Offensive)
* **Overall Score:** **8.8 / 10**
* *Comment:* While the 52.5-degree version is a 'hard spec' aimed at elite athletes, the H47.5 is the **most popular and practical choice** covering a wide range of players from intermediate to advanced levels.



## 2. Core Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **47.5°** (ESN Standard / Medium-Hard)
* *Note:* This is the "Gold Standard" hardness, similar to Tibhar's EL-P or Butterfly's Tenergy 05. It is neither too hard nor too soft.


* **Weight:** **Medium**
* After cutting, it weighs approximately 47~49g. Compared to recent high-hardness rubbers, it is less burdensome and makes it easier to balance the racket.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **MAX (2.1mm)**
* Following current trends, the MAX thickness is recommended to maximize the power of the ball.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[8.5] / 10**
* The flight distance when impacted properly is excellent. However, it doesn't just fly off uncontrollably; it possesses an **"honest" repulsion** that corresponds to the power input by the user. It has wide "gears"—tame on soft touches, but explosive on strong hits.


* **Spin:** **[9.2] / 10**
* This is the rubber's **biggest strength**. The top sheet's grip (friction) is exceptional, ensuring the ball doesn't slip even on thin-contact loop drives. You can feel the unique "strong tension grip" of German manufacturing, distinct from Chinese tacky rubbers.


* **Control:** **[8.8] / 10**
* Thanks to the 47.5-degree hardness, it is much easier to handle than the 52.5-degree version. It offers great stability, particularly in blocking or short-game situations, where the ball doesn't bounce off erratically but stays low and controlled.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium-High**
* The ball draws a generous arc over the net. It provides high stability during topspin loops and significantly reduces errors of hitting the net.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky vs. Solid:**
* Rather than a sharp "Clack!" sound, it feels closer to a **"Thud," deeply hugging the ball**. However, when the impact is precise, it delivers a crisp clicking sensation.


* **Dwell Time:**
* **Long.** The time the ball stays on the rubber is long. The sensation of "chewing the ball and spitting it out" is strong, making the handling very intuitive for directing the ball exactly where the user intends.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Overwhelming "Bite":** It holds the ball deeply, making it very easy for everyone from beginners to experts to generate spin.
* **Versatility:** It boasts "hexagonal" performance (all-round excellence), working effectively on both the Forehand and Backhand.
* **Cost-Performance:** It offers high-end performance (aiming for Tenergy/Dignics levels) but is available at a relatively accessible price point.

**Cons**

* **Spin Sensitivity:** Because the grip is so good, it is quite sensitive to the opponent's spin (services or loops). You need to be careful with angle adjustments during receiving.
* **Durability Issues:** As with high-performance tension rubbers, the edges of the top sheet may chip, and the lifespan is not exceptionally long (typical ESN level).
* **Lack of "One-Shot" Power:** For power hitters used to rubbers harder than 50 degrees, the final speed (second bounce) or destructive power might feel slightly lacking.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced Club Players:** Standard equipment for topspin loop styles.
* **Players wanting to strengthen their Backhand:** The stable arc boosts confidence in backhand drives.
* **Players with weaker impact:** The rubber holds the ball well, compensating for insufficient impact power.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Backhand (Highly Recommended):** Optimal for backhand due to its stability and spin capability.
* **Forehand:** Suitable for female players or control-oriented male players.


* **Similar Rubbers (Brand Comparison):**
* **Tibhar Evolution EL-P:** The closest competitor. H47.5 applies newer technology and is judged to have slightly superior grip.
* **Andro Rasanter R48:** Similar to R48 which uses Energy Cell tech, but H47.5 offers a slightly firmer and more solid feel.

**💡 Coach's Tip:**
If you feel your current rubber is too hard and the ball flies off uncontrollably, or conversely, too soft and lacks power, try switching to the **Jekyll & Hyde H47.5**. It will provide a satisfying **"hand feeling"** that might make you wonder, "Was I always this good at looping?"
