## Jekyll & Hyde C52.5

---

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"A masterpiece that perfectly fuses the overwhelming spin of Chinese rubbers with the explosive speed of German rubbers."**

* **Style:** Hybrid Sticky Offensive
* **Overall Score:** 9.2 / 10

**Overall Review:**
Having tested countless rubbers over 20 years, it is rare to find a product with a concept as clear as its name, 'Jekyll & Hyde.' The C52.5 is the most mainstream yet powerfully destructive model in the **C (China, Sticky)** series. For those who wanted to use Chinese rubbers (like Hurricane) but gave up due to the hassle of boosting or low repulsion, this is the perfect alternative. I would evaluate it as a **"high-performance hybrid rubber with virtually no weaknesses."**

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** 52.5° (ESN Standard)
* *Note: While numerically very hard, the actual feel is around 50° due to the sticky top sheet.*


* **Weight:** **Heavy Side**
* * approximately 50~52g after cutting (standard head size). It may feel slightly burdensome.*




* **Recommended Thickness:** MAX (or 2.1mm)

## 3. Performance Analysis (Scale of 0~10)

* **Speed:** **8.5** / 10
* It isn't the type of rubber that shoots the ball out automatically like pure tension rubbers (e.g., Tenergy 64). However, its **"linear acceleration"** upon impact is exquisite. The speed produced is exactly proportional to the power you put in.


* **Spin:** **9.8** / 10
* This is the reason for this rubber's existence. The strong sticky top sheet firmly grips the ball, creating a **"heavy and deadly"** ball quality. It demonstrates exceptional rotation, especially in services and loop drives, making it difficult for opponents to return.


* **Control:** **8.0** / 10
* In the short game (pushes, drops), the ball doesn't bounce out unintentionally, making control very easy. However, when blocking, it is sensitive to the opponent's spin, so precise angle adjustment is required.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* The trajectory over the net is high and stable. When looping, the ball doesn't die; instead, it clears the net and drops sharply at the end of the opponent's table.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Solid & Grip:**
* Instead of the "clicky" feel of typical German ESN rubbers, it has a strong sensation of the ball **"sticking" to the rubber before being shot out heavily.**


* **Dwell Time:**
* The sponge is hard, but thanks to the sticky top sheet, **the time the ball stays on the racket is long.** This gives the user a sense of psychological stability to direct the ball exactly where they want. The sound is more solid and full rather than a clear metallic sound.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* **Overwhelming Spin Performance:** Delivers top-tier performance in all spin-oriented techniques, including serves and loops.
* **Stability in Short Game:** Thanks to the tackiness, the ball doesn't pop up in short battles (stops, flicks) near the net, allowing for precise play.
* **Ease of Counter-Looping:** Its ability to "catch" the opponent's ball is excellent, so you won't get pushed back during mid-distance rallies.

**Cons:**

* **Weight:** If attached to both sides, the total racket weight can become quite heavy, requiring some physical strength.
* **Impact Requirement:** To utilize the 52.5° hard sponge properly, a certain level of swing speed and impact is necessary. (Beginners might feel the ball doesn't go forward enough).
* **Spin Sensitivity:** While it generates strong spin, it is also sensitive to incoming spin, requiring precise angle adjustments during receive.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced Players:** Recommended for USATT rating ~1600+ (or equivalent local level) who have established impact technique.
* **Power Looper:** Players who score with heavy, spinning drives.
* **Hybrid Entry Users:** Those who find Chinese rubbers burdensome but feel German rubbers are too bouncy.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly Recommended. The best position for delivering finishing shots.
* **Backhand:** Recommended only for advanced players with excellent impact (may be too demanding for average players on the backhand).


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly Dignics 09C:** The ultimate competitor that C52.5 aims to rival. Performance is similar, but XIOM is much more reasonably priced.
* **Tibhar Hybrid K3:** A similar hybrid rubber, though the K3 has a slightly shorter lifespan and a slightly softer feel.

**Coach's Tip:**
The Jekyll & Hyde C52.5 may require an adaptation period of 1-2 weeks when first installed. Initially, it might feel like the ball isn't traveling far, but if you adjust your stroke from a "hitting" style to a **"brushing/looping" style that engages the sponge**, you will be able to utilize 200% of this rubber's true value.
