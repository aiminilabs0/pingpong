This rubber is the top-spec product actually used by Brazilian table tennis star **Hugo Calderano** on both his forehand and backhand.

* **Product Name:** [Used by Hugo] Jekyll & Hyde C57.5
* **Hardness:** **57.5°** (Very hard, high-density sponge)
* **Key Technologies:**
* **Sticky Top Sheet:** Combines the tackiness (stickiness) of Chinese rubbers with the high repulsion (speed) of tension rubbers.
* **X-Factor Technology:** Features dual-tension technology developed via AI to provide powerful repulsion without the need for separate tuning (boosting).
* **Epsilon Sponge:** Small, uniformly placed pores transfer energy without loss, enabling powerful shots.

### 2. Performance Analysis (User Review Summary)

Summarizing user evaluations, it can be described as **"The ultimate complete sticky rubber that requires no boosting."**

| Category | Detailed Evaluation |
| --- | --- |
| **Speed & Power** | **Top Tier.** Thanks to the hard 57.5° sponge, the ball trajectory is very long and powerful when the impact is solid. The dominant opinion is that it holds its own even in mid-to-far distance topspin rallies. |
| **Spin** | The sticky sheet grabs the ball firmly, creating **very strong rotation**. Many users note that the ball travels low and heavy, especially during loop drives. |
| **Control & Short Game** | Because the sponge is hard, the ball doesn't pop out unintentionally on soft touches, making **short game (stops, pushes) very precise**. However, blocking requires precise angles; a passive or lazy block may dump the ball into the net. |
| **Feel** | Described as **"Hard, but with a clear click feel."** It produces a metallic 'clank' sound on strong hits, and the grip feel is distinct and intuitive. |

### 3. Summary of Pros & Cons

**✅ Pros**

* **Overwhelming Peak Performance:** When used by advanced players with good impact, it demonstrates top-tier performance in both speed and spin.
* **Convenient Maintenance:** It delivers performance similar to or higher than tuned Chinese rubbers (like Hurricane) without the need for boosting (oiling).
* **Advantage in Serve & Receive:** Thanks to the sticky surface, it generates high spin on serves and makes short receive control easy.

**❌ Cons**

* **High Difficulty Level:** The 57.5° hardness can be quite burdensome for amateur players. If your impact is insufficient, it is difficult to extract the rubber's performance, and the ball may end up in the net.
* **Heavy Weight:** Due to the high-density sponge, the rubber is on the heavier side. (Be aware of the increase in total racket weight).

### 4. Recommended For

This rubber is **recommended for advanced players rather than beginners or intermediates.**

* Topspin (Drive) style players seeking **powerful knockout shots**.
* Players who previously used **Butterfly Dignics 09C** or **Hurricane 3 (Boosted)** but are looking for stronger repulsion or easier maintenance.
* Players with fast swing speeds and solid impact who can handle a hard rubber.

**💡 Tip:** If the 57.5° hardness feels too demanding, considering the **C52.5** model (slightly softer and easier to handle) from the same lineup is also a good option.
