# Jekyll & Hyde C57.5

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"A hybrid monster that perfectly controls the duality: the overwhelming spin of a Chinese tacky rubber and the explosive power of German tension."**

* **Overall Character:** Power Offensive
* **Overall Score:** **9.2 / 10**
* *(Note: This score is based on advanced players with strong impact; this rubber may be too demanding for beginner to intermediate players.)*



---

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **57.5°** (ESN Standard / Very Hard)
* *The perceived hardness feels like a standard German 53~55°, but the sponge density feels very high.*


* **Weight:** **Heavy**
* *Weighs in the mid-50g range after cutting. Those sensitive to weight must consider the total weight of their racket.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **MAX (2.1mm)**
* *A thick sponge is essential to truly unlock the performance potential of this rubber.*

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **8.5 / 10**
* It doesn't bounce off significantly on passive blocks, but **the moment impact is applied, it delivers distance comparable to tension rubbers.** It radically improves upon the "sluggish" feeling typical of Chinese rubbers.


* **Spin:** **9.8 / 10**
* The reason for this rubber's existence. The strong tacky topsheet grips the ball, creating a **heavy ball quality that is burdensome for opponents to block.**


* **Control:** **7.5 / 10**
* It is stable in the short game (stops, pushes) because the ball doesn't pop up due to the tackiness. However, due to the high hardness, ambiguous impact can cause the ball to dump into the net, requiring a delicate touch.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* It creates a trajectory (arc) that drops sharply over the net. It is advantageous for creating so-called **"nasty balls" (irregular/kick bounces).**

## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Click vs. Solid:** **Solid**
* Rather than a crisp "clicky" sound, it produces a heavy "thud." The vibration transferred to the hand is distinct, allowing you to intuitively know how you struck the ball.


* **Grip & Dwell Time:**
* While the sponge is very hard, **the tacky topsheet provides a long dwell time**, clutching the ball effectively. The sensation of "shooting" the ball after holding it is excellent.

## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Overwhelming Spin Performance:** The power of loop drives is top-tier; the ball stays low after the bounce and accelerates forward.
* **Stability in Short Game:** The tackiness prevents the ball from unintentionally popping up during service reception or short stop techniques.
* **Improved Speed vs. Chinese Rubbers:** It resolves the "distance" issue lamented by users of traditional Hurricane 3 style rubbers, making it lethal even from mid-distance.

**Cons**

* **High Impact Requirement:** The sponge is very hard (57.5°). If the user's swing speed and power do not support it, you will struggle to utilize even 50% of the rubber's performance.
* **Heavy Weight:** It is quite heavy to use on both sides. Not recommended for players with wrist issues or those who prefer light setups.
* **Lifespan & Maintenance:** Being a tacky rubber, you must be diligent about dust management, and the tackiness of the topsheet will diminish over time.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended User:**
* Advanced amateurs and players whose main weapon is a powerful **"one-shot" drive**.
* Users of existing Chinese tacky rubbers (e.g., Neo Hurricane) who want **easier access to speed**.
* **Close-to-table attackers and drive styles** confident in their impact.


* **Recommended Position:** **Forehand**
* *The hardness and weight are likely too burdensome for the backhand.*


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly Dignics 09C:** C57.5 feels harder and more direct; C57.5 has the advantage in price/performance ratio.
* **Tibhar Hybrid K3:** K3 is slightly softer and easier to handle, but C57.5 is rated higher for maximum power and spin ceiling.

**Tip:** This rubber may require a "break-in" period of about 1 to 2 weeks after initial attachment. It may feel too stiff at first, but the true power emerges once the sponge loosens up.

**As a coach, one suggestion:**
If you let me know your current blade model and your primary playing style (e.g., focused on loop drives vs. smashing), I can verify if this rubber is truly the optimal choice for you.
