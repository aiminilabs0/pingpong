## 📌 Product Description

The **Xiom Omega 7 China** series is an offensive table tennis rubber that hybrids traditional Chinese *sticky (top sheet)* rubber with European *tension/sponge technology*. The basic features are as follows:

### 🔥 Key Features

* **Sticky Top Sheet (Tackiness):** Excellent spin generation due to the high adhesion typical of the Chinese style.
* **High Speed & Spin:** Designed to pursue both fast attacks and strong spin performance, making it suitable for powerful topspin attacks.
* **Hard Sponge:** Thanks to the hard and high-repulsion sponge, power transfer during strong hits (smashes) is excellent.
* **For Professional Players:** Classified as a specification usable by pro-level players down to intermediate players.
* **Sponge Hardness:** Hardness options include Ying – approx. **60°** and Guang – approx. **55°**.

📌 In summary,
⚡ It is an offensive rubber where you can feel both the *spin/power of highly sticky Chinese rubber + the speed of tension rubber*.
