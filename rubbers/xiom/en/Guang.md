# Xiom Omega 7 China (Guang/光)

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **Definition:** "A monster-like hybrid created by the collision of Chinese rubber's overwhelming spin and German rubber's explosive speed."
* **Style:** Aggressive (OFF+) / Sticky Hybrid
* **Overall Score:** **9.2 / 10**

> **Review:** The Xiom Omega 7 China is a **'German Sticky Rubber'** designed to allow players accustomed to traditional Chinese rubbers (like Hurricane 3) to generate sufficient travel distance without the need for boosting (oiling). The heavy ball quality, supported by a hard sponge, is excellent. It serves as the ultimate weapon for advanced players with strong impact, but it can be a 'double-edged sword' for beginners who may find it difficult to handle.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **55.0°** (ESN Standard) / Very Hard
* **Weight:** **Heavy** (Approx. 50g~53g after cutting)
* **Recommended Thickness:** **MAX (2.1mm)** - To maximize the sponge's repulsion.

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **9.0 / 10**
* Thanks to the 'Carbon Sponge' applied with ESN technology, the initial speed is quite fast despite being a sticky rubber. Unlike traditional Chinese rubbers, the ball does not drop short but extends powerfully in proportion to your swing speed.


* **Spin:** **9.5 / 10**
* This is the reason for this rubber's existence. The tackiness of the top sheet grabs the ball firmly, creating a trajectory that stays low and **'kicks' sharply** upon landing during loop drives. It is excellent for inducing opponent errors (over-blocking).


* **Control:** **8.0 / 10**
* **Short/Block:** You won't get pushed back by the opponent's strong shots due to the hard sponge.
* **Short Game:** When performing short techniques like Stops or Flicks, the ball doesn't pop out unintentionally due to the sticky surface, offering stable control.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium to High**
* Basically, it draws a good arc. It is **easy to adjust the trajectory** depending on the impact method: a high arc for thin brushing loops and a linear trajectory for thick smashes.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Click vs. Solid:** **Solid**
* Rather than a crisp, metallic 'clicky' sound, it produces a heavy 'thud' or 'chwack' sound.


* **Dwell Time:**
* On weak impact, the ball may feel like it bounces off quickly, but **on strong impact, there is a distinct sensation of the sticky top sheet deeply grabbing and holding the ball.** This 'catch and shoot' feeling is superb.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Overwhelming Spin Performance:** Generates a 'heavy spin' ball quality in services and drives that pressures the opponent.
* **Solved Distance Issue:** Perfectly compensates for the short travel distance of traditional Chinese rubbers with a German tension sponge. (No boosting required).
* **Precision in Short Game:** In the short game near the net, unintended bounciness is minimized, allowing for delicate control.

### **Cons**

* **Heavy Weight:** The rubber itself is heavy, which can burden the wrist for penhold players or those who prefer light rackets.
* **High Impact Requirement:** Because the sponge is very hard (55°), a weak swing will struggle to extract even 50% of the rubber's performance.
* **Sensitive to Humidity:** Like all sticky rubbers, it can suffer from slippage on very humid days, requiring maintenance.

## 6. Recommendations

* **Recommended User:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced** players.
* **Close-to-table Drive Attackers** who previously used DHS Hurricane 3 but find boosting annoying and feel a lack of speed.
* Power hitters confident in their impact who want **'One-Shot' finishing power**.


* **Recommended Position:** **Forehand**
* It may be too heavy and hard for the backhand position. (However, elite-level players with excellent impact can use it on the backhand).


* **Similar Rubbers (Comparison):**
* **Butterfly Dignics 09c:** Softer and more forgiving than Omega 7 China, but more expensive.
* **Tibhar Hybrid K3:** Very similar to Omega 7 China, but has slightly more 'click' feeling and a slightly shorter lifespan.
* **Donic Bluegrip C2:** A similar German hybrid rubber with comparable characteristics.

**Expert's Comment:**

> "Omega 7 China is not a 'fake sticky' rubber. It is a masterpiece that infuses the speed of modern table tennis while keeping the genuine taste of Chinese rubber. However, please judge coldly whether your impact is strong enough to penetrate deep into the sponge before choosing."
