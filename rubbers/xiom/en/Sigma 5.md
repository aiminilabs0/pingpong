## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"Legendary Name Meets Latest Tech (Cycloid): A High-Performance Balanced Rubber That Anyone Can Master."**

Xiom's 'Sigma' series was historically known as a powerhouse lineup superior to the 'Vega' series, but it had a reputation for being difficult to control. The newly released **Sigma 5** retains only the heritage name; it is a completely reimagined rubber equipped with the **latest technologies found in the 'Omega 7' and 'Vega X' series (Elasto Futura, Cycloid)**. It sheds the heaviness of the past, drastically improving 'crisp clickiness' and 'stability' to become a **hexagonal, balanced offensive rubber**.

* **Style:** All-round Offensive (Offensive & Balance)
* **Overall Score:** 8.9 / 10

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** 47.5° (ESN German Standard) - *The "Gold Standard" hardness; neither too hard nor too soft.*
* **Weight:** Average (Estimated 47~49g after cutting) - *Lighter than the past Sigma series.*
* **Recommended Thickness:** MAX (2.0mm+) - *To maximize repulsion and spin with modern 40+ plastic balls.*
* **Applied Tech:** Dynamic Friction, Cycloid, Carbo Sponge.

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** [8.7]/10
* While the initial speed isn't blindingly fast, the sponge absorbs energy upon impact and releases it with an excellent **Catapult Effect**. It is slightly less bouncy than the Omega 7 Pro but significantly faster than the Vega Pro.


* **Spin:** [9.2]/10
* Equipped with **'Dynamic Friction'** technology. Borrowing the principle of snow tires, it grips slippery plastic balls exceptionally well. The "biting" sensation is superb, creating stable rotation during loop drives.


* **Control:** [9.0]/10
* The biggest strength of this rubber. Thanks to **'Cycloid'** technology, the ball's trajectory is formed with high stability. It offers great forgiveness, often lifting balls over the net that feel like they might hit it, resulting in fewer over-misses.


* **Throw Angle:** Medium-High
* The ball doesn't skid low but travels in a stable arc (parabola). This provides psychological stability for topspin drive players.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky vs. Solid:** Very Clicky & Crisp.
* Upon impact, it produces a pleasant metallic "Chang!" sound and a strong sensation of the ball embedding deeply into the rubber before shooting out. Contrary to the "muted and solid" feel of the old Sigma 2, this offers **crisp and sensory feedback**.


* **Dwell Time:** Long.
* Despite the 47.5° hardness, the topsheet is flexible, resulting in a long dwell time. It gives the user the confidence of "holding the ball before shooting it."



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Comfort Without Adaptation:** With the standard 47.5° hardness and excellent balance, it has a low failure rate regardless of the blade it's paired with.
* **Weight Reduction:** Unlike the notoriously heavy legacy Sigma models, the latest sponge technology reduces weight burden.
* **Cost-Performance:** It delivers performance very close to the Omega 7 series but at a more accessible price point.

**Cons**

* **Power Ceiling:** For top-tier players expecting the "monster" power of the Omega 7 Tour (55°) or Omega 7 Asia, the finishing power might feel slightly lacking.
* **Brand Perception:** Because 'Sigma' is an older product name, it may be undervalued or perceived as outdated despite its modern performance.
* **Durability:** Due to the nature of the Dynamic Friction topsheet, a drop in performance may be felt once the tension effect fades (maintains peak performance for approx. 2-3 months).

## 6. Target Users & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate Loopers:** Club players (Local Div 4-6) who prioritize connection and stability in their drives.
* **All-Round Players:** Those seeking a balanced rubber for both forehand and backhand.
* **Players with Lower Impact:** Those who want to feel the "click" and generate speed with less physical force.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** For styles emphasizing control and spin.
* **Backhand:** **Highly Recommended** for intermediate-to-advanced players who use 47.5° on the backhand. (Offers the best balance for backhand drives and blocks.)


* **Similar Rubbers (Brand Comparison):**
* **Tibhar Evolution EL-P:** Very similar in elasticity and hardness feel.
* **Andro Hexer Powergrip:** Similar character as a spin-focused 47.5° rubber.
* **Xiom Vega X:** Sigma 5 feels slightly crisper and has marginally higher repulsion than Vega X.

**[Analyst's Note]**
Many players mistake 'Sigma' for a discontinued old model, but **Sigma 5** is a "hidden gem" reborn on Xiom's latest technology platform (Elasto Futura). If the Omega 7 price tag is too steep, but you want higher performance than the Vega series, Sigma 5 is the perfect choice.
