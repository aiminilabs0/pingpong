# Tibhar Evolution FX-D

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"Dynamic power hidden within a soft feel; a next-generation soft rubber that achieves both 'dwell time' and 'trajectory' simultaneously."**

* **Overall Character:** Balanced Attack (Offensive Control)
* **Overall Score:** **9.1 / 10**
* It drastically improves upon the "lack of power transfer" often found in traditional soft rubbers, resulting in a rubber that is soft yet produces a ball with a lively finish.



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **43.0° ~ 44.0°** (ESN Standard / Medium-Soft)
* Numerically soft, but due to the high-density sponge, the actual feeling may be slightly harder/firmer than the numbers suggest.


* **Weight:** **Average ~ Light**
* Definitely lighter than high-hardness rubbers like the MX-D, making it advantageous for controlling the total weight of the racket.


* **Recommended Thickness:** **Max (or 2.1mm)**
* Due to the soft nature of the sponge, a thin sponge might cause the ball to "bottom out" on the blade too quickly. Therefore, **Max thickness** is highly recommended.



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[8.5] / 10**
* Shows distinctly improved distance compared to the existing FX-P. The "Energy Sponge" effect is excellent, allowing the ball to shoot out efficiently even with weaker impact.


* **Spin:** **[9.0] / 10**
* Thanks to its ability to deeply "hug" the ball, it generates significant spin on loop drives. It performs better when you hit "thick" to bury the ball rather than thinly brushing it.


* **Control:** **[9.5] / 10**
* This is the rubber's greatest strength. In blocks or short games, the ball doesn't pop out unpredictably, allowing the user to place it exactly where they want with stability.


* **Throw Angle:** **High**
* It draws a very good arc (parabola). You can swing boldly without the fear of the ball hitting the net.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Crisp Clicky Feel:**
* Upon impact, there is a clear, pleasant metallic sound (**"Clang" or "Chang"**). It provides great satisfaction for players who prefer rubbers with loud acoustics.


* **Long Dwell Time:**
* There is a strong sensation of the ball **sinking deeply ("Pook")** into the rubber before being catapulted out. It offers a "catch and shoot" feeling, characterized by a chewy and elastic sensation rather than a dull or mushy one.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Stable Consistency:** It has high forgiveness, reducing errors even if the impact is slightly inaccurate.
* **Optimized for Backhand:** Even with limited wrist movement on the backhand, it is easy to create strong spin and speed with minimal force.
* **Improved Power:** It resolves the "bottoming out" issue (where the rubber collapses under strong force) seen in older soft rubbers like FX-P, holding up well under pressure.

### **Cons**

* **Limit on Max Power:** Compared to high-hardness rubbers like MX-D or MX-P, the power may still feel insufficient for pro-level powerful impacts.
* **Weakness in Smashing:** On flat smashes or flicks without spin, the ball might feel like it "dies" or feels too bouncy/unstable.
* **Too Soft for Hitters:** It may feel sluggish or frustrating for "Hitter" style players who prefer a hard and direct impact feel.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Backhand Loop Beginners to Intermediates:** Those wanting to learn backhand feeling and increase stability.
* **Female Amateur Players:** Players looking to generate good distance and spin with less physical force on both forehand and backhand.
* **Stability-Oriented All-Round Players:** Styles that focus on rallies rather than a single knockout shot.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Backhand:** Highly recommended. (Excellent for blocking, defense, and high-arc loops).
* **Forehand:** Recommended for beginners/intermediates or female players.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Andro Rasanter R45:** A modern rubber with similar hardness and energy efficiency.
* **Butterfly Tenergy 05 FX:** The synonym for spin-oriented soft rubbers (FX-D offers better value for money).

**Coach's Comment:**

> "FX-D breaks the prejudice that 'soft rubbers have weak repulsion.' If your backhand block is anxious or your drives keep catching the net, switching to FX-D will likely provide an immediate boost in stability."
