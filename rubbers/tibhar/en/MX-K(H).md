# TIBHAR MX-K (H)

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **"The pinnacle of sharp aggression and refined touch, evolved for the ultimate drive performance."**
* **Overall Orientation:** Offensive
* **Total Score:** 9.2 / 10

## 2. Key Specifications

* **Hardness:** 52.5° (ESN scale) – While numerically high-hard, the topsheet design makes the "effective hardness" feel slightly softer and more playable.
* **Weight:** Heavy (Approx. 48g–51g after cutting, varies by sheet)
* **Recommended Thickness:** 2.1mm (Recommended to maximize the sponge's potential)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0–10 Scale)

* **Speed:** 9.0/10 – The 52.5° high-hardness sponge generates significant catapult effect, ensuring your shots don't lose power even from the mid-to-back zone.
* **Spin:** 9.3/10 – Inheriting the legacy of the Evolution series, it offers immense grip. The arc becomes particularly aggressive when a proper tangential impact is applied.
* **Control:** 8.5/10 – Despite being a high-hardness rubber, the "K" tuning provides better stability in short games and blocks compared to the classic MX-P.
* **Throw Angle:** Medium-High – The ball creates a safe, pronounced arc over the net, reducing net errors while maintaining a deep landing point.

## 4. Feeling

The standout feature of the MX-K(H) is its **"Vivid Click Feeling."** Unlike many 50°+ rubbers that can feel "dead" or like hitting a brick, this rubber provides clear sensory feedback.

* **Dwell Time:** Moderate. It doesn't hold the ball excessively long; instead, it "grabs and shoots" with a crisp, rhythmic tempo that allows the player to feel exactly where the ball is going.

## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Impact Scaling:** The rubber scales honestly; the harder you hit, the more devastating the output.
* **Versatility:** Exceptional for both close-to-table quick attacks and mid-distance counter-looping.
* **Enhanced Durability:** Improved over the original Evolution series, maintaining its "fresh" grip and tension for a longer period.


* **Cons:**
* **Impact Requirement:** Beginners may find the sponge too stiff to activate, resulting in "short" balls if the swing is incomplete.
* **Weight:** Equipping this on both sides can make the racket significantly head-heavy, potentially straining the wrist.
* **Sensitivity:** While control is improved, it still reacts to incoming spin, requiring active stroke adjustment.



## 6. Target Audience & Combinations

* **Recommended User:** Advanced players with solid drive impact, or aggressive attackers looking for a "one-shot" finishing power.
* **Recommended Position:** **Forehand**. (Though it serves as a powerful weapon on the backhand for elite players with high swing speeds.)
* **Similar Rubbers:** * **Butterfly Dignics 05:** Shares a similar pursuit of high spin and power, though the feel differs.
* **Xiom Omega VII Tour:** A great alternative if you prefer a high-hardness sponge with a long trajectory.

**Expert Coach’s Tip:**

> "If you loved the power of the original MX-P but struggled with its 'wild' nature, the MX-K(H) is your perfect upgrade. It tames the beast without losing the bite. It pairs exceptionally well with Inner-Carbon or Outer-ALC blades."
