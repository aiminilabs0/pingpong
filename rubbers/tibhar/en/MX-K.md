# TIBHAR MX-K

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Evaluation

* **"The wild power of the MX-P, tamed for precision and ultimate drive consistency."**
* **Overall Style:** Attack-Oriented All-rounder (Aggressive Balance)
* **Total Score:** **9.2 / 10**

## 2. Key Specifications

* **Hardness:** 47.5° (ESN Standard)
* **Weight:** Average (Slightly lighter than the original MX-P, reducing the burden on the total racket weight)
* **Recommended Thickness:** 2.1mm (Max)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0–10 Scale)

* **Speed: 8.5/10**
* While the raw speed is slightly more controlled compared to the MX-P, the rebound power upon impact remains formidable. It provides ample distance even from the mid-distance zone.


* **Spin: 9.0/10**
* Excellent gripping power and "clicky" sensation that many players crave. The spin production during loop drives is exceptionally honest and predictable.


* **Control: 8.5/10**
* This is the MX-K’s greatest strength. The "overshooting" issue found in the MX-P has been significantly mitigated, making service receives and blocks much more stable.


* **Throw Angle: Medium-High**
* The ball clears the net with a safe margin. The arc is not too low, providing psychological security during long-distance topspin rallies.



## 4. Feeling

* **Impact:** It offers a "crispy" yet solid feedback. You can clearly feel the rubber "grabbing" the ball upon impact. When struck with the right timing, it rewards the player with a distinct and satisfying "click" sound.
* **Dwell Time:** The dwell time is slightly longer than that of the MX-P. This allows the player a split second longer to adjust the ball's placement, leading to higher accuracy in tactical play.

## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Exceptional Balance:** Successfully maintains offensive firepower while drastically improving defensive stability.
* **User-Friendly Tuning:** Specifically refined to meet the sensory preferences of modern club players (great feedback and click).
* **Weight Efficiency:** High performance without the excessive weight penalty, allowing for more flexible blade pairings.


* **Cons:**
* **Slightly Tamer Peak Power:** Players looking for the "raw, unbridled" speed of the original MX-P might find this version a bit too polite.
* **Durability:** Like many high-performance ESN rubbers, the "peak" tension period can be somewhat short.
* **Impact Dependency:** At 47.5°, it still requires a decent level of swing speed and technical foundation to fully activate the sponge.



## 6. Target Audience & Combinations

* **Recommended User:** - Intermediate to advanced players who loved the MX-P but felt it was occasionally too bouncy or erratic.
* Modern topspin attackers who prioritize the transition between stable rallies and finishing shots.


* **Recommended Position:** Primary choice for **Forehand**. However, it is an excellent **Backhand** option for players who execute aggressive backhand drives.
* **Similar Rubbers:** - **XIOM Omega 7 Pro:** Shares a similar balance, though the Omega tends to feel a bit sharper.
* **Butterfly Dignics 05:** While Dignics offers a higher performance ceiling, the MX-K is a much more accessible and cost-effective alternative.
