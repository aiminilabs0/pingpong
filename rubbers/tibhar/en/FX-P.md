# Tibhar Evolution FX-P

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **Definition:** "With a crisp metallic sound and auto-correction level control, it is a magician that erases anxiety from your backhand drives."
* **Style:** All-round Offensive (Control-Optimized)
* **Overall Score:** **8.8** / 10

> **Coach's Comment:** The FX-P is the softest version in the Evolution series. It is the perfect choice for players who prioritize **'Consistency' and 'Stability'** over raw, knockout power. It excels at deeply hugging the ball and safely delivering it over the net, even if your impact is slightly lacking.

## 2. Key Specification Data

* **Hardness:** 40.0° ± (ESN Standard / Soft Sponge)
* **Weight:** Light (Approx. low 60g range uncut, approx. 43~45g after cutting)
* **Recommended Thickness:** 2.1mm ~ Max (Thicker sponge is recommended due to the rubber's softness)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed: [7.5] / 10**
* While it doesn't have the explosive speed of the MX-P, the large-pored sponge provides an excellent **Catapult Effect**, creating sufficient distance with very little effort.


* **Spin: [8.0] / 10**
* The ball stays on the rubber for a long time, making it very easy to generate spin. It produces **stable spin** particularly when lifting backspin balls (loop drives). However, the absolute maximum spin ceiling may be slightly lower compared to harder rubbers.


* **Control: [9.5] / 10**
* This is the FX-P's greatest weapon. It offers excellent placement ability, and it **drastically reduces errors** when blocking opponent's heavy spin or strong attacks.


* **Throw Angle:** Medium-High
* Instead of a straight, laser-like shot, it creates a parabolic trajectory that safely clears the net.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky:** Very Strong.
* There is a distinct **metallic "Crack!" sound** upon impact. This sound helps in establishing a rhythm and provides a satisfying sensation (good "hand feeling").


* **Dwell Time:** Long.
* You can clearly feel the ball sinking deep into the racket before being catapulted out. The sensation of momentarily "grabbing" the ball provides significant psychological stability.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### Pros

* **Overwhelming Ease of Use:** Even beginners or players with weaker impact (swing speed) can easily execute topspin drives.
* **Crisp Sound:** The refreshing sound generated upon impact boosts the player's mood and confidence.
* **Light Weight:** It reduces wrist strain caused by heavy racket setups and is advantageous for securing faster swing speeds.

### Cons

* **Power Limit:** In situations requiring strong impact, such as smashes or counter-drives, the ball may sink too deep, causing a "bottoming-out" effect where energy is lost.
* **Softness/Durability:** Because the sponge is soft, the rubber can easily tear if the racket hits the table edge (durability is relatively lower).
* **Lack of Direct Trajectory:** It is more suitable for spin-oriented play rather than fast-tempo, piercing blocks or flat smashes.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended User:**
* Backhand drive beginners or **stability-oriented players** who focus on blocking.
* **Beginner to Intermediate players** whose impact mechanics are not yet fully developed.
* Amateurs who dislike the "mushy" or "hard" feel of stiff rubbers and value the sound of the hit.


* **Recommended Position:** **Backhand** (Most strongly recommended) / Can be used on Forehand for players with lower power.
* **Similar Rubbers (Alternatives):**
* **Butterfly Tenergy 05 FX:** Offers slightly better speed and spin than the FX-P, but is much more expensive.
* **Andro Rasanter R37:** Recommended if you are looking for a model that is even softer and more focused on control.
* **Donic Bluefire M3:** A cost-effective alternative with similar hardness and feeling.

**Expert Tip:** The FX-P tends to lose its signature clicky feel and bounce rapidly once it reaches the end of its **lifespan**. If the sound becomes dull, consider it time to replace the rubber.
