# Tibhar Evolution EL-D

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"The perfect evolution of 'Mid' for players who found MX-D too demanding and EL-P slightly lacking in power."**

* **Style:** All-round Offensive (Offensive / Balance)
* **Overall Score:** **9.2** / 10

**Overall Review:**
The EL-D acts as the backbone of Tibhar's top-tier "D (Dynamic)" series. While its "big brother," the MX-D, requires pro-level impact, the EL-D offers **"controllable power" that can be widely utilized by intermediate to advanced amateur players.** It offers improved resilience and spin quality compared to the existing bestseller EL-P, and features an excellent balance between the sensation of holding the ball and shooting it out.

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **45.0° ~ 47.0°** (ESN Standard) / Tibhar Standard: 'Medium-Hard'
* *Note: It feels harder than the existing EL-P, but definitely softer than MX-P or MX-D.*


* **Weight:** **Average ~ Slightly Heavy**
* *Approx. 48g~50g after cutting (varies by racket head size). It has the characteristic density of the Evolution series but is lighter than the MX-D.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm ~ Max**
* *To fully utilize the performance of the latest ESN rubbers, thicker sponges are recommended.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (Scale of 0~10)

* **Speed:** **[8.8] / 10**
* With the application of the 'Red Energy Sponge,' the travel distance is quite good. Even with weaker impact, the ball doesn't die and stretches out cleanly. It shows sufficient power, especially in mid-distance topspin rallies.


* **Spin:** **[9.3] / 10**
* This is EL-D's biggest strength. The top sheet's grip is excellent, biting the ball firmly even on thin-contact loops. It is advantageous for creating **sharp, high-spin balls** rather than just heavy, bludgeoning shots.


* **Control:** **[9.0] / 10**
* It offers great forgiveness compared to harder rubbers. It is easy to suppress the ball from popping out during blocks, providing standout stability that reduces over-hitting errors.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium-High**
* The trajectory forms higher than the MX-D. It is easy to draw a safe "arc" over the net, making topspin (drive) stability very high.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky:** Clear. You can hear a pleasant metallic "click" sound upon impact, and the sensation transmitted to the fingertips is distinct.
* **Dwell Time:** **Long.**
* Despite being a relatively firm sponge, the sensation of the ball momentarily burying deep into the rubber before catapulting out is excellent. It offers the optimal feeling for players who prefer a "catch and shoot" style of play.



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

* **Excellent Balance:** Achieves a hexagonal balance where Speed, Spin, and Control are not heavily skewed in any one direction.
* **High Stability:** Draws a high arc during loops, drastically reducing net errors.
* **Improved Durability:** Uses a sponge with larger pores compared to the early Evolution series (P-series), improving tension longevity.

**Cons:**

* **Weight:** Can feel somewhat heavy compared to rubbers of similar hardness from other brands (especially Japanese brands).
* **Shrinkage:** The characteristic ESN shrinkage phenomenon (rubber shrinking over time after opening) still exists (caution required when gluing).
* **Impact Requirement:** For complete beginners, the repulsion might be too strong, leading to over-hitting errors.

## 6. Recommended Target & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced** amateur players with a topspin (loop) style.
* Players who used **EL-P** but felt a lack of power.
* Players looking for performance similar to **Tenergy 05** but considering cost-performance.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Backhand:** Optimal for advanced players and pros for backhand rallies or defense.
* **Forehand:** Suitable for intermediates or female players who prioritize connection and placement over pure power.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly:** Tenergy 05 (*Feeling is different, but the targeted performance is similar*)
* **Andro:** Rasanter R48
* **Xiom:** Omega VII Euro

**[Coach's Advice]**
If your current racket is a special material blade containing carbon (e.g., Viscaria, Timo Boll ALC), EL-D will create the best synergy when attached to the **Backhand**. If your forehand impact is not extremely powerful, it will also be an excellent choice for the Forehand.
