# Tibhar Hybrid MK Pro

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Verdict

> **"Infusing Power into Kenta Matsudaira's Signature Feel: Heavy power hidden within precise control."**

While the original 'Hybrid MK' bet everything on control and stability, the **MK Pro** is a model that reinforces distance and power by increasing the sponge hardness while maintaining that specific "ball-holding sensation." It doesn't just blindly catapult the ball; it demonstrates "reliable offensive power" that extends accurately and heavily in proportion to the force you apply.

* **Style:** All-round Offensive (Offensive Balance)
* **Overall Score:** 9.2 / 10

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **51° (ESN Standard)**
* *Expert Comment:* Although the spec says 51°, the actual feeling upon impact is closer to **48°~49°**. Thanks to the flexible topsheet, it feels "firm and taut" rather than "hard as a rock."


* **Weight:** **Medium**
* It weighs around 48g~50g after cutting. This is a manageable weight compared to other recently released high-hardness rubbers.


* **Recommended Thickness:** Max

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed: [8.5] / 10**
* It is not a style that bounces off wildly like ultra-high tension rubbers (e.g., MX-P). However, the energy transfer when engaging the sponge is excellent, creating sufficient distance even from mid-to-far distance.


* **Spin: [9.3] / 10**
* This is the true value of this rubber. Despite not being a tacky (sticky) rubber, the surface grip is exceptional. It shows great spin performance on both thin brushing loops and thick impact drives.


* **Control: [9.5] / 10**
* The stability is hard to believe for a 51° rubber. When blocking an opponent's heavy spin drive, the ball doesn't fly off unpredictably; the "stability" to send the ball exactly where you want is outstanding.


* **Throw Angle: Medium-High**
* It clears the net with a safe margin and draws an arc that drops sharply at the end of the table.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Deep Dwell Time:**
* The time the ball stays on the racket is long. The expression **"It eats the ball and spits it out"** fits this rubber perfectly.


* **Solid over Clicky:**
* Rather than a crisp, metallic click sound, you feel a heavy, **solid** sensation at your fingertips as if gripping the ball tight. It provides a familiar feeling to users who prefer high-end Japanese rubbers (like Tenergy).



## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Seamless Adaptation:** It serves as the perfect bridge for users of existing 47.5° rubbers who want a power upgrade without feeling a drastic change in hardness.
* **Superior Short Game:** When executing short techniques like drops (stops) or flicks, the ball doesn't bounce unintentionally, allowing for precise placement.
* **Backhand Stability:** It is easy to generate spin without requiring extreme impact, aiding in the improvement of backhand loops and blocking techniques.

**Cons**

* **Absolute Speed Limit:** It might feel slightly sluggish for players who rely solely on flat smashing or want bullet-like speed with minimal effort.
* **Lifespan (Estimated):** Since the surface grip is high, it can be somewhat sensitive to humidity, and the duration it maintains "peak" grip is average (not exceptionally long).
* **Impact Requirement:** To utilize the 51° sponge to 100% and create a "knockout shot," some level of impact training is required.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **"Technicians"** who win points through spin quantity and course placement.
* **Intermediate-to-Advanced players** who feel standard 47.5° rubbers are too soft but find 53°+ rubbers too burdensome.
* **All-round Offensive players** who want to secure both stable connection and power.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Backhand (Highly Recommended):** Optimal for stable blocking and sharp backhand loops.
* **Forehand:** Suitable for loop-drive players who prioritize control.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* *Butterfly Tenergy 19:* Similar ball-holding sensation and trajectory.
* *Donic Bluestorm Pro AM:* Possesses similar hardness and grip feeling.

**Coach's Tip:**

> "Because of the name 'Hybrid,' some people mistake MK Pro for a sticky (tacky) rubber. This rubber surface is **not sticky**. The name implies a **'Hybrid' of German sponge technology and Japanese rubber playing feel**. If you want the pure sensation of holding the ball without the unique/weird feeling of tacky rubbers, this will be the best choice."
