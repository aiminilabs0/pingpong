# Tibhar Evolution MX-S

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

* **Definition:** "A **masterpiece of spin** that explodes the moment it meets powerful impact, offering zero compromise."
* **Style:** Spin-Oriented Offensive
* **Overall Score:** **9.1 / 10**
> **Review:** This is the most 'Spin-specialized' rubber in the Evolution series. While the best-selling MX-P boasts explosive speed and a spring-like catapult effect, the MX-S provides tenacious grip and generates a heavy ball quality. However, it is a 'rubber for experts' that is difficult to utilize 100% if the user's impact is weak.



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **47.5°** (ESN Standard) / Approx. 36.0~38.0° (converted to Butterfly/Japan standard)
* *The sponge is hard, and the pimple structure of the topsheet is denser than the MX-P, making it feel slightly harder in actual play.*


* **Weight:** **Heavy**
* *Weighs in the low-to-mid 50g range after cutting. It is on the heavier side, even among ESN rubbers.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1~2.2mm (Max)**

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **8.5 / 10**
* It doesn't have the effortless bounce of the MX-P. However, the distance is sufficient when proper impact is applied, and the lack of excessive bounciness allows for full swings with fewer over-shooting errors.


* **Spin:** **9.8 / 10**
* The reason for this rubber's existence. The topsheet has excellent grip capability, creating **heavy spin that is burdensome for opponents to block** during loop drives or power drives.


* **Control:** **8.5 / 10**
* Because the catapult effect is not excessive, stability in the short game (stops, pushes) and service reception is excellent. Its 'Linearity' (honesty)—where the ball goes exactly as much as you push it—is a standout feature.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium**
* It produces a trajectory that is slightly lower or medium compared to the MX-P. It is good for creating sharp arcs that dive low over the net rather than high, floaty balls.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Clicky vs. Solid:** **Solid (Firm and Heavy)**
* Instead of a crisp, metallic 'click' sound, it produces a 'thud' or heavy 'chwack' sound.


* **Dwell Time:**
* On weak impact, the ball doesn't bounce much and feels hard. However, **on strong impact, there is a distinct sensation of the ball sinking deep into the rubber** before shooting out. The friction of the topsheet is very high, so there is almost no feeling of slippage.



## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Overwhelming Spin:** Whether close to the table or at mid-distance, if you brush the ball, the spin bites hard.
* **Stability in Rallies:** The excessive tension effect (spring effect) is suppressed, allowing you to swing confidently without fear of the ball flying off the table.
* **Durability:** The lifespan of the topsheet is relatively longer and more robust compared to the MX-P.


* **Cons:**
* **Heavy Weight:** When attached to both sides, the total racket weight increases significantly, which can burden the wrist.
* **High Impact Requirement:** Players with slow swing speeds or lack of power may feel the ball dumping into the net or find the rubber feels 'dead'.
* **Lack of Flexibility:** It lacks the 'automatic' feature where the rubber does the work for you on passive shots.



## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended Users:**
* **Intermediate to Advanced players** who can generate power with their own swing.
* Drive-style players who prefer **continuous loops and spin-oriented play** over a single smash.
* Power hitters who felt the MX-P wore out too fast or was difficult to control.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** For decisive shots based on powerful spin.
* **Backhand:** Only for players with very strong backhand impact or block-oriented players seeking stability. (May be too heavy/burdensome for the average club player's backhand).


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly Tenergy 05:** The textbook standard for spin-oriented rubbers (MX-S feels slightly harder and heavier).
* **Nittaku Fastarc G-1:** Very similar in its hard feeling and spin-focused nature.
* **Donic Bluefire M1:** A hard rubber with powerful spin and a high throw angle.

**Coach Gemini's Note:**

> "The MX-S is a rubber that 'chooses its user.' However, if you are confident in your swing speed and desire a heavy, penetrating ball quality rather than light speed, the MX-S will be your best partner."
