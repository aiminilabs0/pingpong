# Tibhar Evolution MX-P 50

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Rating

> **"Awakening the Beast of the Bestseller: A Weapon for Hard Hitters that adds Overwhelming Power to the Original MX-P's Grip."**

It maintains the signature "biting" grip of the original MX-P but increases the sponge hardness to **maximize ball weight and extend trajectory**. While it may feel too hard and difficult for players with weak impact, it offers ultimate power to those who can handle it.

* **Style:** Power Offensive
* **Overall Score:** **9.2** / 10 (Based on Advanced Level)

## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **50.0 degrees** (ESN Standard)
* *Note: It is distinctly harder than the original MX-P (approx. 47.5 degrees). When pressed with a finger, you can feel a firm resistance.*


* **Weight:** **Heavy Side**
* *After cutting, it weighs around 50g~52g (standard head size), making it quite heavy.*


* **Recommended Thickness:** **2.1mm ~ 2.2mm (Max)**
* *Choosing this rubber implies a desire for power, so maximum thickness is recommended over thinner options.*



## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** **[9.5]** / 10
* While the initial "pop" might feel less bouncy (more linear) than the original MX-P, the **maximum distance is significantly longer** when proper impact is applied.
* The power from mid-to-far distance is exceptional; the ball does not die out and extends all the way to the end of the table.


* **Spin:** **[9.3]** / 10
* The grip of the topsheet remains top-tier.
* Because the hard sponge strongly supports the ball, **driving through the ball (thick contact)** creates a heavier spin quality compared to thin brushing contacts.


* **Control:** **[7.0]** / 10
* Frankly, this is not an easy rubber to tame. It feels less "automatic" compared to the original version.
* In short games or blocking, if the user does not set the angle precisely or lacks active input, the risk of net errors or over-hitting increases.


* **Throw Angle:** **Medium**
* While the original MX-P had a somewhat high arc, the 50-degree version produces a **slightly lower and more direct trajectory**. The ball tends to pierce sharply just over the net.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Solid & Direct:**
* Where the original MX-P felt slightly "mushy" and held the ball deeply, the MX-P 50 has a strong **"solid support and kick"** feeling with a distinct click.


* **Shorter Dwell Time:**
* The time the ball stays on the rubber feels shorter. Therefore, you need a **fast swing speed** to snatch the ball instantly, otherwise, it may feel like the ball is slipping.



## 5. Pros & Cons

### **Pros**

* **Overwhelming Power:** If your impact supports it, it produces a heavy ball quality that opponents find difficult to block.
* **Stable Counter-Attacks:** When countering a heavy loop (counter-topspin), the sponge does not collapse but holds firm, allowing for precise counters.
* **Clear Feedback:** It has a linear character where the output is exactly proportional to the input force.

### **Cons**

* **Heavy Weight:** Attaching this to both sides significantly increases the total racket weight, which can strain the wrist.
* **High Impact Requirement:** If your swing speed is slow or impact is weak, you won't even extract 50% of the rubber's performance (balls will likely dump into the net).
* **Durability:** Once the moist, grippy feel of the topsheet fades (usually after 2~3 months), performance degradation is quite noticeable.

## 6. Recommendations & Combinations

* **Recommended User:**
* **Advanced Amateurs** or former players.
* **Power Hitters** who rely on a powerful "kill shot" drive.
* Players who felt the original MX-P was too soft or experienced the ball "bottoming out" during hard impact.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly recommended for powerful forehand drives.
* **Backhand:** Unless you are a very high-level player with excellent backhand impact, it may be too demanding.


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Donic:** Bluestorm Z1 Turbo (Similar hardness and speed profile).
* **Xiom:** Omega 7 Tour (Hard sponge with a direct clicky feel).
* **Butterfly:** Dignics 05 (Similar style, but Dignics is more expensive and has longer durability).

**Expert's Advice:**
The MX-P 50 is undeniably an attractive rubber, but using equipment that exceeds your skill level can be detrimental to your game. The combination with your current blade is also crucial.
