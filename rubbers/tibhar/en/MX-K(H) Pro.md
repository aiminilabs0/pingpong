## 2. Key Specifications

* **Hardness:** **52.5°** (ESN Scale) / High-density hard sponge

---

## 3. Performance Analysis (0–10 Scale)

* **Speed: 9.2/10** Featuring the high repulsion unique to high-hardness sponges. While the initial speed feels slightly more controlled than the Tibhar MX-P, the travel distance and "second kick" after hitting the table are overwhelming when full impact is applied.
* **Spin: 9.5/10** The core strength of the MX-K Pro series. The top sheet possesses exceptional grip, ensuring almost zero spin loss during close-to-table topspins or counter-looping rallies from the mid-distance.
* **Control: 8.5/10** Despite the high 52.5° hardness, it doesn't feel "unforgiving." It excels in short-game scenarios like pushes and drops, where the ball doesn't pop up unexpectedly, allowing for precise placement.
* **Throw Angle: Medium-High** The ball draws a stable, safe arc over the net. Rather than a purely linear trajectory, it creates a sharp curve that drops rapidly at the opponent's end of the table.

## 4. Feeling

* **Click/Feedback:** Rather than a sharp "pop" like the MX-P, it offers a **heavy, "grippy" sensation** where the ball feels like it sticks to the rubber before being propelled forward.
* **Dwell Time:** Despite being a hard-sponge rubber, the flexible top sheet provides a **surprisingly long dwell time.** This gives the player a strong sense of "holding" the ball, allowing for better guidance and confidence in shot direction.

## 5. Pros & Cons

* **Pros:**
* **Elite Spin Generation:** Produces top-tier rotation whether you are brushing thin or hitting through the ball thick.
* **Consistency in Transition:** Unlike some hard rubbers that feel "dead" on weak impacts, this maintains great stability during consecutive looping rallies.
* **Customized Performance:** Designed with specific feedback to bridge the gap between European speed and Asian spin preferences, offering a "hard yet intuitive" feel.


* **Cons:**
* **Weight Burden:** The high sponge density adds significant weight to the racket; players should be mindful of wrist strain.
* **Impact Requirement:** Not ideal for beginners; it requires a certain level of swing speed and impact to fully activate the sponge.
* **Top-sheet Wear:** Due to the performance-oriented grippy nature, players may notice a gradual drop in friction over time with heavy use.

## 6. Target Audience & Combinations

* **Recommended User:** * Intermediate to advanced **loop-oriented attackers.**
* Players who liked the power of the MX-P but found the control lacking.
* Players transitioning from Chinese tacky rubbers to German rubbers (due to the similar "grabby" sensation).


* **Recommended Position:** **Forehand (FH)** highly recommended (to maximize the power from strong impact).
* **Similar Rubbers:** * **Donic Bluestorm PRO:** Shares the high-hardness, spin-oriented stability.
* **Butterfly Dignics 05:** While the feel differs, the goal of high-trajectory, spin-heavy play is similar.
