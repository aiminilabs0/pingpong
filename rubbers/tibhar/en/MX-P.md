# [Analysis Report] Tibhar Evolution MX-P

## 1. One-Line Summary & Overall Review

> **"The textbook power rubber that posed the strongest challenge to the dominance of Tenergy 05, possessing an explosive finishing shot."**

* **Style:** Typical Offensive (OFF+) / Power Loop & Fast Attack
* **Overall Score:** **9.2 / 10**
* (Despite the time passed since its release, it remains one of the best-sellers in the current market.)



## 2. Key Spec Data

* **Hardness:** **45.7° ~ 47.5° (ESN Standard)**
* *Note:* While the numerical value is 47.5°, the combination of a hard topsheet and large-pored sponge makes the **actual playing feel closer to 48°~49°** (quite firm).


* **Weight:** **Heavy Side**
* Approximately 50g~52g after cutting (standard head size). This can be burdensome for users sensitive to weight.


* **Recommended Thickness:** 2.1mm ~ 2.2mm (MX-P reveals its true value at max thickness.)

## 3. Performance Analysis (0~10 Scale)

* **Speed:** [9.5] / 10
* Offers long trajectory and very high initial speed. The so-called 'Catapult Effect' is outstanding, providing immense repulsion on impact.


* **Spin:** [9.0] / 10
* Generates a 'heavy' ball quality on strong impacts. Destructive spin is created when digging deep into the sponge rather than thin brushing.


* **Control:** [7.5] / 10
* Due to high repulsion, it is prone to over-shooting errors. Delicate force control is required, especially in the short game (stops, short pushes). It can be overwhelming for beginners.


* **Throw Angle:** Medium
* Rather than drawing a high, safe arc like Tenergy 05, it exhibits a sharp, penetrating trajectory that shoots low over the net and drops deep at the endline.



## 4. Actual Feeling

* **Harmony of Solidity and Click:** Basically feels **Solid**, but upon strong impact, the large-pored sponge contracts and expands, offering a distinct **Clicky** sensation.
* **Short Dwell Time:** Rather than feeling like it holds the ball for a long time, the sensation is more direct—**"Grabbing tight and shooting like a cannon."** The feedback that your power is instantly transferred to the ball is exhilarating.

## 5. Pros & Cons

**Pros**

* **Overwhelming Cost-Performance:** Delivers high-end performance comparable to competitors (Tenergy, Dignics series) at a more accessible price point.
* **Explosive Power:** Provides speed and distance that doesn't falter even from mid-to-far distance, making it optimized for hitting winners.
* **Clear Feedback:** The vibration and sound transmitted to the hand when the impact is correct are very distinct.

**Cons**

* **Shrinkage:** The rubber tends to shrink significantly after opening. After gluing, you may find the blade edges exposed after some time.
* **Heavy Weight:** Attaching this to both sides can easily push the total racket weight over 190g, which may cause elbow issues for players lacking muscle strength.
* **Durability:** The initial performance (the so-called 'factory booster effect') lasts about 2~3 months, after which the repulsion tends to drop somewhat sharply.

## 6. Recommended Target & Combination

* **Recommended User:**
* Intermediate level or above (USATT 1800+ equivalent) playing a topspin drive style.
* Power hitters confident in their impact who aim to score with decisive shots.
* Players who find Tenergy 05 too expensive but want similar performance.


* **Recommended Position:**
* **Forehand:** Highly recommended. Optimized for powerful forehand drives.
* **Backhand:** Unless you are an advanced player or former pro, the weight and speed might be difficult to handle. (The softer sibling, EL-P, is recommended for the backhand.)


* **Similar Rubbers:**
* **Butterfly Tenergy 05:** (The benchmark target for MX-P; 05 has a higher arc and is lighter.)
* **Xiom Omega VII Pro:** (Similar speed, but feels slightly firmer and more direct.)

**Coach's Comment:**
MX-P is a proven product, often called a "Classic" for a reason. However, just because it is "good" doesn't mean beginners should buy it blindly; the ball flies so well that you might struggle with control. It is the best weapon to choose when your swing form is established and you feel, **"My shots lack a bit of power."**
